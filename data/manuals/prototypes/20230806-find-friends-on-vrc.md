VRCX is an assistant application for VRChat that provides a more convenient way to manage various aspects of VRChat than relying solely on the VRChat client (desktop or VR) or website. It also includes several other useful features.

To get started with VRCX, download and run the latest installer (`VRCX_Setup.exe`) from [here](https://github.com/pypy-vrc/VRCX/releases).

VRCX offers a wide range of features:

**Friend, World, and Avatar List Management**: Manage your friends list, world/group/avatar lists outside of VRChat. Monitor the world/avatar activity of your friends and check their online status. Keep track of when you first added them and when you last saw them. See how much time you've spent together in worlds and how many times. Keep track of friend name changes. Save notes to help remember how you met.

**Automatically Launch Apps When You Start VRChat**: You can configure VRCX to launch other apps when you start VRChat. For example, you could have VRCX launch an OSC app or a voice changer app when VRChat opens up.

**World Persistence**: For worlds that support the feature, VRCX can save world settings, save states, inventories, and other data! Note: To use this feature, you must have "Allow Untrusted URLs" enabled in your VRChat settings.
