# Project Mirage

| Step | Description | Dependency |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | An avatar's face is created in a digital format, similar to drawing a portrait on a computer. | None |
| 2 | The colors of the avatar are changed using Penpot, like using a digital paintbrush to change the color of a painting. | Created digital avatar |
| 3 | The best looking avatars are chosen from a large group, like picking the best apples from a tree. | Changed colors of the avatar |
| 4 | A body is added to the avatar using Blender's CC0 base mesh, like adding a body to a mannequin head. | Chosen best looking avatars |
| 5 | An attempt is made to create a 3D model of the back of the avatar (this wasn't successful), like trying to sculpt the back of a statue but not getting it right. | Added body to the avatar |
| 6 | A tool is used to simplify any image, like using an eraser to remove details from a sketch. | Unsuccessful attempt to create a 3D model of the back of the avatar |
| 7 | Clothing and accessories are added to the avatar for Vroid Hub, like dressing up a doll. | Simplified image |
| 8 | A 2D reference image is used in Blender, like using a photograph to help draw a picture. | Added clothing and accessories to the avatar |
| 9 | The 2D image is placed in front of the 3D model, like placing a picture in front of a sculpture to use as a reference. | Used 2D reference image in Blender |
| 10 | An image is captured from the camera's point of view and sharpened, like taking a photo and then enhancing its clarity. | Placed 2D image in front of the 3D model |
| 11 | A tool is used that takes any image and generates a text caption, like writing a description for a photograph. | Captured and sharpened image from the camera's point of view |
| 12 | The color of the clothing is corrected and the pleated folds are ignored for the first try, like adjusting the colors in a painting and ignoring the small details for now. | Generated text caption from image |
| 13 | A complex structure involving sculpting and rigging is created, like building a skeleton for a clay model. | Corrected color of the clothing |
| 14 | The avatar is imported into Godot Engine and "Project Mirage", like moving a digital file from one folder to another. | Created complex structure involving sculpting and rigging |
| 15 | The imported avatar is refined in "Project Mirage", like polishing a newly built machine. | Imported avatar into Godot Engine and "Project Mirage" |
| 16 | Spring bone "jiggle bones" are converted to phys bones and colliders, like changing the springs in a toy to make it more realistic. | Refined the imported avatar in "Project Mirage" |
| 17 | Painting errors such as shirt seams and mesh clipping problems with the spine bone remain, like leaving some imperfections in a painting. | Converted spring bone "jiggle bones" to phys bones and colliders |
| 18 | A choice is made between using the existing VRM MToon material in "Project Mirage" or using a friend's custom SCSS shader, like choosing between two different types of paint for a painting. | Left painting errors unfixed |
| 19 | Issues with "Project Mirage"'s material counts and bones are dealt with, like solving problems in a complex puzzle. | Made a choice between using the existing VRM MToon material in "Project Mirage" or using a friend's custom SCSS shader |
| 20 | A process is established for moving files between "Project Mirage" and Godot Engine, like setting up a conveyor belt between two factories. | Dealt with issues with "Project Mirage"'s material counts and bones |
| 21 | Vroid Hub's hair painter and mesh generator are used, like using a special tool to add hair to a doll. | Established process for moving files between "Project Mirage" and Godot Engine |
| 22 | "Perfect sync", which are facial expressions for motion capture, is added, like giving a puppet the ability to show emotions. | Used Vroid Hub's hair painter and mesh generator |
| 23 | Motion capture is set up using the Steam VR Lighthouse system, overcoming significant difficulties, like setting up a complex tracking system to record movements. | Added "perfect sync" facial expressions for motion capture |
