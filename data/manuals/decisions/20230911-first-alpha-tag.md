## The Backdrop

In software development, semantic versioning (semver) is a popular method for versioning software. It provides a clear and concise way to communicate changes in versions and the associated implications.

## The Challenge

The challenge lies in correctly denoting the first alpha release in semver. This is crucial as it communicates the stability of the software and sets expectations for users and developers.

## The Strategy

In semver, the first alpha release would typically be denoted with a hyphen followed by the word "alpha" and a number. For example, it could be something like "0.1.0-alpha.1". The specific alpha release number may vary depending on the project and its release cycle.

## The Upside

Using semver for alpha releases helps to set clear expectations about the stability and features of the software. It allows developers and users to understand that the software is in an early stage of development and may not yet have all planned features or be fully stable.

## The Downside

The downside could be the potential confusion around the naming convention, especially for those unfamiliar with semver. However, this can be mitigated through clear documentation and communication.

## The Road Not Taken

An alternative approach could be to use a different versioning system or to not denote alpha releases specifically. However, these approaches may not provide the same level of clarity and communication as semver.

## The Infrequent Use Case

While the alpha release notation is common in semver, it may not be used frequently in projects that have shorter development cycles or that do not release alpha versions to the public.

## In Core and Done by Us?

Yes, this strategy of using semver for denoting alpha releases is a core part of the V-Sekai project management and release process.
