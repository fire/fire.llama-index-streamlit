## Context and Problem Statement

Gaming often involves defeating enemies, but current blood effects lack realism and immersion.

## Proposed Solution

Implement a realistic blood simulation system considering factors like enemy type, weapon, and environment.

## Implementation

1. **Blood simulation system**: Develop a system generating realistic blood effects.
2. **Integration**: Ensure compatibility with existing game mechanics.
3. **Optimization**: Minimize performance impact.
4. **Testing & refinement**: Test extensively and refine based on feedback.

## Positive Consequences

- Enhanced realism and immersion
- Improved visual effects
- Increased player satisfaction

## Negative Consequences

- Increased development time and resources
- Potential performance issues
- Unsuitability for some games or audiences

## Option graveyard

- Simpler blood effect system
- Pre-rendered blood effects only

## Script workaround?

No, significant development effort is required.

## Core implementation rationale

Easier integration, optimization, control, and refinement as part of the core game engine.
