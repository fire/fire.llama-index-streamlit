### Context and Problem Statement

This is a proposal to mask the loading time, but it doesn't solve it.

### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Trim the steps needed to enter the game.

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

When you first start up the application, you will see a loading screen. This screen will be displayed until all the assets needed to load your world have been downloaded.

When switching between worlds, there is technically no need for a loading screen. Both leading platforms have chosen to include one in their applications, but this is not necessary. The leading platform displays a loading screen when clicking to go to a new world, while the secondary leading platform does not display one--you stay in your original world while also loading into the second world and then switch over once enough of it has been downloaded that you can be there.

You click go and are left in your current world while loading in the other world, once the other world is completely loaded in you are transported to it instantaneously.

### Positive Consequences

    Able to mask loading times
    Able to direct players to the positive parts of v-sekai

For style points we could enforce portals that seamlessly transport you between different worlds, at least, as the default option, you place a portal, it has a camera, and you can walk through it, and after a certain point it disappears.

### Negative Consequences

    coordinating cats

The drawback to the multi-world load is that it is more resource intensive, though it should only last a short while, so if we do go that route it should be an option to use a loading screen instead.

It makes for a far less friction-less experience

But again, resource intensive issues, so will have to be optional

We could even add a little button you click once you are ready to be transported, so it doesn't happen against your will if your trying to say something last minute.

### Option graveyard

- Option: The status quo. <!-- List the proposed options no longer open for consideration. -->
- Rejection Reason: This solves nothing. <!-- List the reasons for the rejection: (the bad traits) -->


### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Not script.

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

World traversal is a problem.
