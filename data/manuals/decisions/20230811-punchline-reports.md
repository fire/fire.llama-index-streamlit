## The Backdrop

Communication and project management within your game development team can be better.

## The Challenge

Using the reverse reporting style in game development, the project manager gets the most important information first, followed by supporting details.

## The Strategy

### 1. Punch Line

This is where you present the facts related to the game development process. For example:

```markdown
"The AI behavior for enemy characters wasn't completed on time, and we didn't start the level design for Stage 3 as planned."
```

or

```markdown
"Completed the character modeling as scheduled."
```

### 2. Current Status

In this step, you explain how the punch line affects the game development project. For instance:

```markdown
"Because of the incomplete AI behavior, the game testing has been delayed by a week."
```

### 3. Next Steps

Here, you propose solutions to the problem if there are any. An example could be:

```markdown
"I will be able to complete the AI behavior in the next four days but the level design for Stage 3 will still be behind schedule."
```

### 4. Explanation

Finally, you provide the reasons behind the punch line. This is where you can give a detailed account of why things happened the way they did. For example:

```markdown
"Three days' delay in AI behavior is due to an unexpected bug in the pathfinding system, and the remaining delay is due to being called to assist the graphics team with texture optimization."
```

## The Upside

The upside of this strategy is that it allows for clear and concise communication within the team. It ensures that everyone is aware of the current status of the project and what needs to be done moving forward.

## The Downside

The downside is that it requires all team members to be diligent in their reporting. If someone fails to accurately report their progress or issues, it could lead to miscommunication and delays in the project.

## The Road Not Taken

An alternative approach could have been to use traditional reporting methods, where each team member provides a detailed report of their work. However, this method can often lead to information overload and important details may get lost in the process.

## The Infrequent Use Case

This strategy may not be as effective in smaller teams or projects where communication is more direct and less formal.

## In Core and Done by Us?

Yes, this strategy should be implemented by us as it aligns with our goal of improving communication and project management within the team.
