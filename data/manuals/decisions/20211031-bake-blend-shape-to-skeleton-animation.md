# Bake blend shape to skeleton animation

### Context and Problem Statement

Blend shapes are expensive and hard to interpolate

### Describe the feature / enhancement and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Want to bake blend shapes to animations.

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams

`./DemBones -i="Face_Geom.fbx" -a="Face_Anim.abc" --bindUpdate=2 -o="Decomposition_20_grouped_face.fbx" --nnz=8 -b=256`

Note that the corresponding fbx is 0.01 scale while the alembic is in meters.

The RMSE = 0.00433256 must be this low.

Do not pass #dembones if the RMSE is like 3.5.

Next step is to integrate an existing 3d skeleton.

### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Not a few lines of script.

### Positive Consequences

### Negative Consequences

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?
