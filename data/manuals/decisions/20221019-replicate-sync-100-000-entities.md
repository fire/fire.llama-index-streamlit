# Replicate sync 100'000 entities using a solution (Revision 1)

## Context and Problem Statement

Develop a performant and robust (correctly and with liveness) network entity sync in V-Sekai.

A client is one Godot Engine connection, it can view and change entities.

There are 100'000 networked entities in a city and we go from position a to position b in a loop in a mover with one or more attached cabins.

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

This document is a general problem statement.

## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Large sims!

## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

## Option graveyard: <!-- same as above -->

- Option: Current V-Sekai replication
- Rejection Reason: Can't link servers

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Entity replication is not trivial.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

We're doing the networking layer.

### Questions

How many clients can be in this simulation?

The state database should be smaller to avoid replication traffic on non-liveliness.

## Math

The calculation of who to pair and to find nearby or relevant players is a N^2 loop. Use better algorithms to lower O (N^2) into O (N log N).

The proposed solution can be solved in O (N log N).
