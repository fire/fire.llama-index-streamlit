### Context and Problem Statement

The roadmap presented here is short-term.

  subgraph Short Term
    A[May 16th, 2023] --> B[Solving SkeletonIK3D before May 30th. Will literally debug the two implementations in lockstep.]
    B --> C[Assist Tokageit with Godot Engine 4.1 features before May 30th feature freeze]
    B --> D[Assist Godot Engine 4.1 features before May 30th feature freeze]
    C --> E
    D --> E[Vrm upload to the asset library after May 30th, 2023]
    E --> F[Unidot fix import bugs that blocked assets import]
    F --> G[Unidot Unity Import upload to the asset library after May 30th, 2023]
    G --> H[Implement onevoip]
  end
```

### Positive Consequences

We can create V-Sekai easier.

### Negative Consequences

Overhead might be hard.

### Option graveyard

- Implementing a custom voice chat solution instead of using onevoip
- Waiting for Godot Engine 4.2 instead of assisting with 4.1 features
- Ignoring SkeletonIK3D issues and focusing on other aspects

### If this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

No. This is a process.

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

This is a core process for V-Sekai.
