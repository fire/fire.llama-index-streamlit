### The Upside

The upside of this online event is that it provides a platform for individuals from various backgrounds to showcase their talents, learn from each other, and collaborate on projects. It also helps in promoting the use of VR/AR technologies and encourages innovation in this field.

### The Downside

The downside could be the potential logistical challenges involved in organizing such a large-scale online event. There might also be issues related to ensuring fair participation and dealing with intellectual property rights.

### The Road Not Taken

An alternative approach could have been to organize smaller, more frequent online events throughout the year. However, we decided to go with a larger annual event to create more impact and allow participants enough time to prepare.

### The Infrequent Use Case

While the event is designed to cater to a wide range of participants, there might be some who might not be able to participate due to lack of access to necessary technology or skills. We plan to address this by providing resources and learning materials to help them get started.

### In Core and Done by Us?

Yes, the event is being organized by us, OMIGroup, in collaboration with V-Sekai. We are responsible for planning, coordinating, and executing aspects of the event. The success of such a large-scale online event relies on the collective efforts of many individuals and organizations.
