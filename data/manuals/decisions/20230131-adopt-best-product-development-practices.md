### Context and Problem Statement

We should adopt best practices in developing products.

### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Toyota has a system that was designed with decades of best practices.

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

1. Coordination Based on Writing
2. Mentoring Supervisors
3. Integrative Leaders
4. Standard Skills 
5. Flexible Work Standards 
6. Living Design Standards 

The six mechanisms that make up the quality control system are mentoring supervision, chief engineers, cross-functional communication, working instructions and standards.

Mentoring supervision serves mainly to build functional expertise, but it also teaches young engineers how to write and interpret reports, work with chief engineers, and understand and use standards. The chief engineer's prestige reinforces the importance of expertise while it also balances out the functional bent of the other engineers. The chief engineer also promotes mutual adjustment by providing the working instructions for each vehicle program and by resolving cross-functional disagreements.

The second mechanism is cross-functional communication. Every major feature requires at least an introduction so it needs a corresponding page with a descriptive title.

### Positive Consequences

We are able to use V-Sekai easier.

### Negative Consequences

These aspects can be incompatible with current practices.

### Option graveyard

- Option: The status quo. <!-- List the proposed options no longer open for consideration. -->
- Rejection Reason: This solves nothing. <!-- List the reasons for the rejection: (the bad traits) -->


### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Knowing what to do is hard.

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

How we develop the project is a core task.
