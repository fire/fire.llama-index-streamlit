### Positive Consequences

We can create V-Sekai easier.

### Negative Consequences

Overhead might be hard.

### Option graveyard

We can avoid planning.

### If this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

No. This is a process.

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

This is a core process for V-Sekai.
