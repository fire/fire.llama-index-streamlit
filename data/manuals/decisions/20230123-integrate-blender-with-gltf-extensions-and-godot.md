# Better Godot Engine integration with Blender with gltf extensions

### Context and Problem Statement

Integration between blender and Godot Engine could be better.

### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

The import of Godot Shaders to Godot Engine can help developers and developer artists workflows.

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

Write a design for embed the Godot shader and material information in the exported GLTF as an extension, then parse it in the Godot importer 

### Positive Consequences

Easier to use Godot Engine

### Negative Consequences

The Godot Engine shader definition may change

### Option graveyard

Status quo.

Can we do nothing?

### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

This is probably a folder of python scripts.

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

We manage the Godot Engine import experience.
