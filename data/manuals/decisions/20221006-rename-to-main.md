## Context and Problem Statement

Not all the branches are released and are currently named godot4. They should be renamed to main.

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Rename all godot4 branches to be main for v-sekai-game.

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

need some consensus. I think that given v-sekai-game has only one branch it should be named

Lyuma — Today at 16:11

I agree provided we do the same with the submodules
