## Context and Problem Statement

We have conflicts on how to merge Godot. We need to organize our strategies.

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

We will write a decision flow chart on what to do.

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

Is it upstreamable?

If upstreamable, commit to your own godot fork, and submit a Godot PR.

Then, add this commit into the .gitassembly

If not upstreamable, and intended as a V-Sekai specific feature, make the commit in the V-Sekai godot fork, don't submit a godot PR, and add to the .gitassembly.

If two upstreamable commits conflict, that is a godot problem because it implies the upstream open PRs would be broken if they both merged. There are two options:

First, if the resolution to this merge conflict is itself something which must be upstreamed, a new PR should be opened or communication needs to happen between the PR maintainers.

Temporarily, a new V-Sekai branch could be created which resolves this conflict while waiting for the upstream Godot maintainers to resolve the build issues.

Workflow for updating merge script.

1. Make a local commit to merge-script-master
2. Run the merge script
3. If successful, push (might happen automatically)

## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Easier to remember solutions.

## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Loss of flexbility.

## Option graveyard: <!-- same as above -->

- Option: Do adhoc decisions.
- Rejection Reason: Not a better strategy.

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

This is a workflow design.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

Only we care about our own policies.
