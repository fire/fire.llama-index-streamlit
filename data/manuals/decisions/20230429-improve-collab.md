### Context and Problem Statement

The V-Sekai project has an extensive roadmap with short-term, mid-term, and long-term goals, but it lacks a project manager and struggles to find collaborators who share the vision and can dedicate enough time to contribute. How can we improve the collaboration process and attract more contributors to work on the project more effectively?

### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

The proposed option to overcome the limitation of attracting more contributors and improving collaboration is to develop clear and concise project documentation, including a visual roadmap using mermaid.js, and establish a transparent contribution process. This will provide a structured environment for new and existing contributors to collaborate and understand the project's goals and priorities.

#### How it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

- [ ] A well-organized project documentation and visual roadmap will help potential contributors understand the project's scope and vision, allowing them to make informed decisions about contributing.
- [ ] A transparent contribution process will facilitate collaboration by providing guidelines, resources, and communication channels for contributors.
- [ ] Onboarding new contributors with tutorials and mentorship will help them quickly become productive and dedicated team members.
- [ ] Regular meetings and progress updates will keep the team motivated and focused on achieving milestones.
- [ ] Recognizing and rewarding contributors will foster a sense of community and commitment, making it more likely that they continue contributing to the project.

With these measures in place, the V-Sekai project will overcome its current limitations, making it easier for the team to work together and attract new contributors.

### Describe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

Develop a clear and concise project documentation that outlines the project's goals, requirements, and milestones. Establish a transparent and structured contribution process, including:

1. Create a centralized repository for documentation, code, and assets, with clear guidelines for contributing.
2. Develop a project roadmap with prioritized tasks, deadlines, and assigned responsibilities.
3. Implement an onboarding process for new contributors, including tutorials, resources, and mentorship.
4. Organize regular meetings and communication channels for updates, progress reports, and collaboration.
5. Recognize and reward contributors for their work, fostering a sense of community and commitment.

### Positive Consequences

1. Improved collaboration and communication among the team
2. Attracting more contributors with diverse skill sets
3. Faster progress towards project milestones
4. Clear understanding of project goals and priorities


### Negative Consequences

1. Increased management and coordination overhead
2. Potential for disagreements on priorities and approaches


### Option graveyard

1. Relying on informal communication and ad-hoc collaboration
2. Continuing with the current approach without a structured process


### If this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

While it may be possible to work around some aspects of the problem with a few lines of script, it would not address the underlying issues of attracting and retaining contributors or improving collaboration. The proposed solution aims to create a more sustainable and efficient environment for the V-Sekai project, which cannot be achieved with a temporary workaround or a simple script.

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

As the primary developers of the project, the V-Sekai team has the best understanding of the project's goals, objectives, and priorities. Implementing this feature in-house will ensure that the solution aligns well with the project's vision and addresses the specific needs of the project.
