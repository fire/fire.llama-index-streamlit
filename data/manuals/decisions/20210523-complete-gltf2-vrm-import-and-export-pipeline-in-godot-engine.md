# Complete glTF2 / VRM import and export pipeline in Godot Engine

## Context and Problem Statement

We are unable to import characters in animations and unable to export them.

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

VRM and glTF import allows us to bring models in and export allows us to get the models out.

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams

To be determined.

## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Character import supports
- World export support

## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Technical debt

(this section can be repeated for each option, if more than one option is open for consideration

## Option graveyard: USDZ

List the proposed options no longer open for consideration.

List the reasons for the rejection: (the Bad traits)

- Requires GDNative
- Complicated

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Possible to be gdscript

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

We need to provide trust for the toolchains.
