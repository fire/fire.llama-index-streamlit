## Problem Statement

V-Sekai contributors lack the knowledge to create decent designs for navigating complex 3D environments with obstacles and walls, limiting user experience and potential applications.

## Proposed Solution

Develop a comprehensive training program for V-Sekai contributors that focuses on designing effective navigation systems for complex 3D environments.

## Implementation

1. Identify key concepts and best practices for designing navigation systems in 3D environments.
2. Create a curriculum that covers these concepts and best practices, including hands-on exercises and real-world examples.
3. Organize workshops or webinars led by experienced professionals in the field of 3D environment design.
4. Provide access to resources such as articles, tutorials, and online courses for self-paced learning.
5. Encourage collaboration and peer review among contributors to share knowledge and improve designs.
6. Evaluate contributors' progress and provide feedback to ensure continuous improvement.

## Positive Consequences

- Improved design skills among V-Sekai contributors.
- Enhanced user experience and potential applications.
- Increased collaboration and knowledge sharing within the community.

## Negative Consequences

- Additional time and resources required for training and development.
- Potential delays in project timelines due to training commitments.

## Option graveyard

- Hiring external designers with expertise in 3D environment navigation.
- Ignoring the issue and continuing with suboptimal designs.

## Enhancement Workaround

No simple workaround; a comprehensive training program is necessary to improve contributors' design skills for navigating 3D environments.

## Core Reasoning

Investing in the development of V-Sekai contributors' design skills is essential for enhancing user experience and expanding the potential applications of the platform.
