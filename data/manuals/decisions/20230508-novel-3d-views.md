## Context and Problem Statement

We want to create 3D models from a front-shot of the garment.

## Proposed Solution

Use Meta's image segmentation model and zero123's 3D reconstruction algorithm to generate novel 3D views of garments from a single front-shot image.

## Implementation

1. **Preprocess the input image**: Resize and normalize the input image to meet the requirements of Meta's image segmentation model.

2. **Extract the garment using Meta's image segmentation model**:
   - Load the pre-trained Meta's image segmentation model.
   - Pass the preprocessed input image through the model to obtain the segmented garment image.

3. **Prepare the segmented garment for 3D reconstruction**:
   - Load segmented garment image into zero123's 3D novel view algorithm.

4. **Apply zero123's 3D reconstruction algorithm**:
   - Load the pre-trained zero123's 3D reconstruction model.
   - Pass the prepared segmented garment image through the model to generate novel 3d views of the garment.

5. **Generate novel 3D views of the garment**:
   - Rotate the 3D camera at intervals of 20 degrees around the garment to capture multiple 3D views.

6. **Manually model the garment using views**:
   - Use a 3d design tool like Blender to create a mesh.

## Positive Consequences

- Enhanced user experience with realistic 3D garment previews.
- Improved understanding of garment fit and style.
- Increased creator satisfaction.

## Negative Consequences

- Potential increase in computational resources required for processing.
- Possible limitations in accuracy and quality of generated 3D models.

## Option graveyard

- Using multiple images for 3D reconstruction (discarded due to not enough aligned input images for 3D construction).

## If this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

No, this enhancement requires integration of advanced image segmentation and 3D reconstruction algorithms, which cannot be achieved with a simple script.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

Yes, implementing this feature as part of our core project will improve our opensource community of creators.
