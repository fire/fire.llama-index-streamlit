### Context and Problem Statement

What is the V-Sekai Roadmap and Goals?

### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

The roadmap presented here is short-term.

### Describe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

By avoiding work on User Generated Content (UGC) and world building, we can prioritize the three main states in the roadmap: "World / Avatar Performance" (WAP), "Networking" (NET), and "UI/UX". This allows the team to focus on the core aspects of V-Sekai and achieve the goals more efficiently.

1. **Monitoring and Logging System Test**:
    1. Setup logging framework
    2. Configure monitoring system
    3. Create a dashboard

2. **Test Environment with Simulated Data Test**:
    1. Create test scenarios
    2. Generate simulated data
    3. Configure test environment
    4. Execute test scenarios
    5. Analyze test results

### Positive Consequences

- Easier creation of V-Sekai.
- Focused development on core aspects.

### Negative Consequences

- Potential overhead challenges.

### Option graveyard

- Waiting for Godot Engine 4.2 instead of assisting with 4.1 features.

### If this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

No. This is a process.

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

This is a core process for V-Sekai.
