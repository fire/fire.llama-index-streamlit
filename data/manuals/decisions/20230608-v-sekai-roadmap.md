### Context and Problem Statement

  subgraph Short Term
    A[June 08th, 2023] --> D[IK Points for V-sekai]
    D --> E[Investigate ManyBoneIK & mediapipe to support Facial Mocap to ARKit 52 blendshape and audio to face]
    E --> F[Elixir mvsqlite Serversidecar]
    F --> I[Add jitter buffer to godot_speech]
  end
  subgraph Mid-term Term
    D --> E[Vrm upload to the asset library]
    F --> G[Unidot Unity Import upload to the asset library]
    G --> H[Add jitter buffer to godot_speech]
    H --> I[Implement onevoip]
  end
```

### Positive Consequences

We can create V-Sekai easier.

### Negative Consequences

Overhead might be hard.

### Option graveyard

- Implementing a custom voice chat solution instead of using onevoip
- Waiting for Godot Engine 4.2 instead of assisting with 4.1 features
- Ignoring SkeletonIK3D issues and focusing on other aspects

### If this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

No. This is a process.

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

This is a core process for V-Sekai.
