## Problem Statement

V-Sekai users struggle navigating complex 3D environments with obstacles and walls, limiting user experience and potential applications.

## Proposed Solution

Create a 12x12 meter 3D map with 2-meter-high obstacles and walls. Implement a navigation system for users to move around while avoiding obstacles and walls.

## Implementation

1. Design the 3D map using modeling software (e.g., Blender).
2. Import the map into a game engine.
3. Implement a character controller for navigation.
4. Add collision detection and response.
5. Optimize navigation system performance.

## Positive Consequences

- Improved user experience.
- Increased V-Sekai applications.
- Enhanced immersion.

## Negative Consequences

- Additional development time and resources.
- Potential performance issues if not optimized.

## Option graveyard

- Using pre-built navigation systems.
- Ignoring the limitation.

## Enhancement Workaround

No simple workaround; complex implementation required for seamless user experience.

## Core Reasoning

Improving navigation is essential for enhancing user experience and expanding V-Sekai's potential applications.
