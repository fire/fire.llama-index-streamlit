# Improving xr grid with new enhancements

## Metadata

- **Status:** proposed
- **Deciders:** V-Sekai, fire, detox,
- **Tags:** V-Sekai

## Context and Problem Statement

We are developing an xr grid project, but it's in a nice easy to understand state.

## Considered Options

DETOX suggested comparing different modes of navigation before making any changes. Fire shared that they have three modes in mind: blob pen, 2D beautifications for 3D, and patch mode. However, these are not functioning correctly yet due to complexity.

## Decision Outcome

Fire will think up some UI for xr-grid, create a simple UI system based on GUI in VR, and add it to xr-grid. We also discuss the possibility of adding a glTF export menu and other features to the UI.

## Positive Consequences

The team is considering various improvements such as fixing grid bugs, exporting loadable content in Blender, adding branding/instructions, and improving the UI.

## Negative Consequences

The main challenge is to avoid bloating the main project with art tools. This might require branching or forking the project.

## Prospects for the Future

DETOX suggested creating a branch for the new features, while Fire expressed a desire to work on networking. They also discussed the possibility of building a tool similar to Cassie on the branch.
