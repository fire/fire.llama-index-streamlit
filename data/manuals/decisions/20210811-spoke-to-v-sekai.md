# Spoke to V-Sekai

### Context and Problem Statement

We desire portable content.

### Describe the feature / enhancement and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Create an art workflow.

```nomnoml
[Blender] -> [OMI.glb]
[OMI.glb] -> [Godot Engine Packed Scene]
```

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams

Create an OMI Blender addon under W3C license.

Create glTF2 extension pull request for Godot Engine.

**Flow**:

1. OMI importer to Blender
2. Exporter of extended blender with OMI extensions to extended gltf
3. Support for OMI extended gltf in godot with definition of in-memory format for OMI extensions in Godot Engine for bidirectionality.

**Expected output**:

1. Export/Import as OMI format in Blender
2. Support OMI GLB in Godot

### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Interlapping projects are complicated.
