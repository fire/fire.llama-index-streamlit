### Context and Problem Statement

We want to activate things in vr

### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Show a menu on each hand and have it be possible to activate grid cell options.

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

1. Trigger presents a menu
2. Short press
3. Long press 

### Positive Consequences

We are able to use V-Sekai easier.

### Negative Consequences

We cannot get other features to trigger things.

### Option graveyard

- Option: The status quo to go out of the game to trigger menus. <!-- List the proposed options no longer open for consideration. -->
- Rejection Reason: This solves nothing. <!-- List the reasons for the rejection: (the bad traits) -->


### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Knowing what to do is hard.

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

Usability is a core feature.
