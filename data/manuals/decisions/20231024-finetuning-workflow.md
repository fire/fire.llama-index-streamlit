## The Backdrop

We have multiple tasks each with a minimum of 100 samples and we want to fine-tune the latest models with our data. We are considering using the [Axolotl](https://github.com/OpenAccess-AI-Collective/axolotl) library in a mode that batches the inputs.

## The Challenge

The challenge is to effectively use these samples to fine-tune the model for each task without overfitting, while also ensuring that the model generalizes well to unseen data.

## The Strategy

1. **Data Preparation**: First, we need to prepare our data for each task. This involves cleaning the data and splitting it into training and validation sets.

2. **Model Selection**: Next, we select the latest models that we want to fine-tune. These could be models from Hugging Face's model hub or any other source.

3. **Fine-tuning with Axolotl**: We will use the Axolotl library for fine-tuning. We can batch-mask our inputs to efficiently utilize our computational resources. This process will be repeated for each task.

4. **Evaluation**: After fine-tuning, we evaluate the model on our validation set for each task to see how well it performs.

## The Upside

By fine-tuning the latest models on our specific tasks, we can potentially achieve better performance than using pre-trained models out-of-the-box. Also, Axolotl provides an easy-to-use interface for fine-tuning models.

## The Downside

Fine-tuning models requires computational resources and time. Also, with only 100 samples per task, there's a risk of overfitting.

## The Road Not Taken

An alternative approach could be to use data augmentation techniques to increase the size of our dataset before fine-tuning.

## The Infrequent Use Case

If we have tasks that are infrequently performed, it might not be worth the effort to fine-tune a model specifically for these tasks.

## In Core and Done by Us?

Yes, this strategy involves us actively participating in the fine-tuning process.
