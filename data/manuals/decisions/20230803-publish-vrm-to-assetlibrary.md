## Context and Problem Statement

We currently support an older revision of the VRM standard for avatars. However, VRM 1.0 is a new revision that we need to implement. A key feature of this new revision is the ability to export VRM 1.0 files. Additionally, we also need to publish our implementation to the Godot Engine asset library.

## Proposed Solution

### Steps

1. Analyze the current implementation of the VRM standard in our system.
2. Understand the changes and enhancements introduced in VRM 1.0.
3. Plan the implementation of VRM 1.0 support, including the export feature.
4. Implement the planned features and changes.
5. Test the newly implemented VRM 1.0 support in different scenarios.
6. Prepare the implementation for publishing to the Godot Engine asset library.
7. Publish the implementation to the Godot Engine asset library.

## Implementation

The implementation details will be decided upon acceptance of this proposal.

## Positive Consequences

- Enhanced avatar functionality with VRM 1.0 support.
- Ability to export VRM 1.0 files, increasing compatibility with other systems.
- Staying up-to-date with the latest standards in the industry.
- Increased visibility and usage through publishing to the Godot Engine asset library.

## Negative Consequences

- Requires understanding of the new VRM 1.0 standard.
- Potential increase in development time due to the complexity of implementing a new standard and preparing it for publishing.
- Need to maintain the published asset in the Godot Engine asset library.

## Option Graveyard

This section will be filled as we explore different options and discard those that are not feasible or effective.

## If this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Given the complexity of implementing a new standard like VRM 1.0 and publishing it to the Godot Engine asset library, it cannot be simply worked around with a few lines of script.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

Implementing VRM 1.0 support and publishing it to the Godot Engine asset library is crucial for staying competitive and relevant in the industry. It also aligns with our goal of providing the best possible avatar functionalities to our users.
