## Introduction

V-Sekai is a virtual reality (VR) platform that offers users the opportunity to immerse themselves in virtual worlds. However, there are certain limitations that hinder the overall user experience. This documentation aims to address these limitations by proposing specific areas for improvement within V-Sekai.

## The Challenge

V-Sekai currently faces several limitations, including non-functional menus in VR mode and a limited number of available worlds. To overcome these challenges and enhance the user experience, we must prioritize and focus on one area for improvement.

### Proposed Solutions

**Exploring Backend Services Integration**: Integrating V-Sekai with backend services can enhance the platform's features and capabilities. This could involve incorporating external APIs or services to provide additional resources and functionalities.

## The Strategy

To ensure efficient use of time and resources, it is advisable to choose one area to focus on and strive to complete it within a two-week timeframe. This focused approach allows for significant progress in improving V-Sekai.

## Upsides

By addressing these limitations, V-Sekai can be transformed into a more immersive and engaging VR platform. Enhancing menus and object pickup mechanics, expanding the variety of worlds, or integrating backend services can greatly enhance the overall user experience for users.

## Downsides

Given the limited timeframe, it may not be possible to address all the identified limitations simultaneously. Prioritizing one area means that other aspects may need to wait for future improvements. Additionally, the complexity of the chosen area may present challenges in achieving substantial improvements within the two-week timeframe.

## The Road Not Taken

While focusing on one area is recommended for the given timeframe, it's important to acknowledge that there are other potential avenues for improvement. Exploring options such as performance optimization, improving UI design, or implementing additional features can be considered in future iterations of V-Sekai.

## In Core and Done by Us?

The development team at V-Sekai should primarily handle the implementation and integration of the chosen improvement. However, collaborative efforts, involving developers, designers, and technical writers, are essential for documenting the enhancements.
