## Context and Problem Statement

V-Sekai currently has a limitation in converting 3D models from the GLB format to the Godot Engine packed scene format. This conversion process is essential for seamless integration of 3D assets into the V-Sekai platform.

## Proposed Solution

Implement serverless edge functions using Deno to handle the conversion of GLB files to Godot Engine packed scenes and manage data storage and retrieval.

## Implementation

1. **Wasm edge functions**: Utilize WebAssembly (Wasm) to run the edge functions efficiently.
2. **Compute time estimation**: Estimate the required compute time for the conversion process.
3. **Data storage**: Set up a storage system for the converted Godot packed scenes.
4. **Table editing UI**: Create a user interface for managing the stored Godot packed scenes.
5. **Edge Function use case**: Implement the following serverless Deno functions:
   - `glbToGodotPackedScene`: Convert a GLB file to a Godot packed scene and store it.
   - `insertGodotPackedScene`: Insert a Godot packed scene into the V-Sekai server.
   - `helloWorld`: Return a JSON object containing "Hello, World!" as a test function.

## Positive Consequences

- Seamless integration of 3D assets into the V-Sekai platform.
- Improved performance and reduced latency due to edge computing.
- Scalable and maintainable architecture with serverless functions.

## Negative Consequences

- Additional complexity in setting up and managing serverless functions.
- Potential increase in costs due to serverless architecture.

## Option graveyard

Use the current process of editor upload.

## If this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

No, this enhancement is essential for the seamless integration of 3D assets into the V-Sekai platform and cannot be easily worked around with a simple script.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

Yes, this feature is crucial for the V-Sekai platform's functionality and user experience. Implementing it as a core feature ensures that it is well-integrated, maintainable, and scalable.
