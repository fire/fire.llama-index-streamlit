## Context and Problem Statement

V-Sekai is a virtual world platform that allows users to create and share content. However, there are limitations in terms of content validation and distribution, which can lead to potential security risks and slow content delivery.

## Proposed Solution

Implement server-side validation export followed by a sanitization service and integrate with a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for efficient content distribution.

## Implementation

1. **Server-side validation**: Develop a server-side validation system that checks the uploaded content for any malicious code or vulnerabilities.
2. **Sanitization service**: Implement a sanitization service that cleanses the content from any harmful elements before it's distributed.
3. **CDN integration**: Integrate the platform with a CDN to ensure fast and reliable content delivery to users worldwide.

## Positive Consequences

- Enhanced security: Server-side validation and sanitization will help prevent malicious content from being distributed.
- Improved performance: CDN integration will speed up content delivery and provide a better user experience.
- Scalability: The proposed solution will allow the platform to handle increased traffic and content uploads efficiently.

## Negative Consequences

- Increased development time: Implementing the proposed solution may require additional development time and resources.
- Maintenance: Ongoing maintenance of the server-side validation, sanitization service, and CDN integration will be required.

## Option graveyard

- Client-side validation only: This option was discarded due to its limited effectiveness in preventing malicious content distribution.
- No CDN integration: This option was discarded as it would not address the issue of slow content delivery.

## If this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

No, the proposed solution requires a more comprehensive approach to ensure secure and efficient content distribution.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

Yes, implementing server-side validation, sanitization service, and CDN integration is essential for maintaining the platform's security and providing a seamless user experience. These features should be part of the core functionality to ensure consistent performance and reliability.
