# Following Tracks: Enhancing VR Train Station Simulation in V-Sekai using Godot Engine

## Metadata

## The Backdrop

V-Sekai is a platform that specializes in VR development with the Godot engine. It's currently facing challenges because there isn't a test game available. The goal is to develop a minimal viable product for a train station simulator. This simulator will focus on avatar rendering, networking simulation, and parented objects in the train.

## The Challenge

The main problems are the need for precise controls in VR and the ability to render and network large groups of people in VR. This also includes extensive NPC tests with skeletal animation in the Godot engine for VR.

## The Strategy

The strategy involves adding new features to V-Sekai to address these challenges:

1. **Networking Avatar Crowds:** The aim here is to develop efficient methods for networking large groups of avatars in VR. This will involve creating a system that can handle the high data traffic required for real-time interaction between numerous avatars, while maintaining performance and stability. This could be achieved by implementing advanced networking protocols and optimization techniques to ensure smooth communication between avatars without overloading the network.

## The Upside

If this strategy is implemented successfully, it could enhance the user experience in VR games developed using the Godot engine. It could also enable the creation of more diverse and complex VR environments.

## The Downside

This process may require significant resources and time, and there might be technical limitations.

## The Road Not Taken

An alternative could have been to use a different game engine that already supports these features. However, this wouldn't contribute to the improvement of the Godot engine.

## The Infrequent Use Case

These improvements might not benefit all types of games or developers. Their relevance depends on the specific needs and goals of each project.

## In Core and Done by Us?

V-Sekai's expertise in VR development and understanding of its challenges make it well-suited to lead these improvements. By doing so, V-Sekai can align with developer needs, contribute to the open-source Godot engine, and help build a stronger community around it.

Despite requiring effort and resources, the potential benefits for both V-Sekai and the wider Godot engine community make it a worthwhile investment.
