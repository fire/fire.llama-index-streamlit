### Context and Problem Statement

 We don't know which are maps and avatars are compatible to load.

> Add date and version number to maps list

Can also be add xmp metadata packets to each packed scene.

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

When the user presses launches the game, there should be no unnecessary steps.

### Positive Consequences

It is easier to pick content that is loadable.

### Negative Consequences

We cannot get other features in.

### Option graveyard

- Rejection Reason: This solves nothing. <!-- List the reasons for the rejection: (the bad traits) -->


### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

1. this requires a server change
2. this requires a godot engine change

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

Usability is a core feature.
