### Context and Problem Statement

The goal of text mining is to extract useful information from text. Text mining applications range from simple document search to complex clustering and recommendation systems.

Search is a process that ranks results by how closely they match a query string.

Clustering is when text strings are grouped by similarity.

Recommendations are items with related text strings that are recommended to users.

Anomaly detection is identifying outliers with little relatedness.

Diversity measurement analyzes similarity distributions.

Classification groups text strings by their most similar label

### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

I want to see what applications we can use do when we convert godot engine resources to embeddings.

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

When the user presses launches the game, there should be no unecessary steps.

### Positive Consequences

We can store embeddings.

### Negative Consequences

We don't have a good way to convert to embeddings yet.

### Option graveyard

- Option: The status quo. <!-- List the proposed options no longer open for consideration. -->
- Rejection Reason: This solves nothing. <!-- List the reasons for the rejection: (the bad traits) -->


### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Not a few lines of script.

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

This is probably not core unless we want to do search and annotations.
