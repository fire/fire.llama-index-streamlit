# Notify community members and users about activity and updates via a Discord bot

- Status: draft

## Context and Problem Statement

We want a way to notify community members and users about activity and updates.

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

A discord bot would be able to inform users via Discord about updates and changes.

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

We would connect to Discord API from Elixir using one of several integration libraries.

We can report #information such as server player count by editing a message; or updating the bot status.

I would also like to poll #information such as CI/CD builds and deployments. We could make an API where someone or something can post a message displayed in Discord using curl or some command, though we would have to make sure this is locked behind a secret key. Unclear.

## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Grow the community
- Help us manage the project

## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Maintenence costs of having a service fed

# Other proposal: Integration with Discord via Webhook

## Positive Consequences

- Lower maintenance burden

## Negative Consequences

- No access to commands or statuses. Only capable of posting messages.

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Yes, it is possible to script querying the itch.io or Uro shards API. This proposal aims to make this #information more accessible to those who would not script it.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

We need this to grow the community.
