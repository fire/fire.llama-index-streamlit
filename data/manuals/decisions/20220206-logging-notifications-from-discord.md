## Context and Problem Statement

We use discord to log changes. At any moment, Discord can disappear.

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Use DiscordChatExporter to export our change notifications.

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

1. generate a bot key
1. enter key
1. select channels to write to
1. export while being careful to be in utc.

## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Logs can be created for notificiations.

## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Need to avoid Discord selfbots

## Option graveyard: <!-- same as above -->

- Option: Current status.
- Rejection Reason: Discord servers can be arbitrarily lost.

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Not a trivial amount of coding to log into Discord.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

We are the ones designing and using Discord.
