## Context and Problem Statement

Blend shapes are slow to render.

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Bake blend shapes to skeletal animation.

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

1. I want to bake blendshapes
   - 52 face blendshape face movements
   - VRM blend shapes
   - The blend shapes are interpolated between 0s and 1s.
   - single animation track.
2. I can send it to dem #bone and bake the blend shapes.

### Dem #bone baking procedure

2. Remove empties that are unused.
3. Extract the blend shape from the mesh
4. Export as alembic 1 meter is 1 unit. Flatten hierachy.
5. Note that all transforms on un-rigged meshes should be applied.
6. Remove the skeleton and fbx export as 1 meter is 0.01 units.
7. Run dem #bone (parameters to be determined)

```bash
./dembones -i="a.fbx" -a="a.abc" -z=4 --bindUpdate=2 -b=200 -o="a_res.fbx"
# Note that RMSE should be in the same range as 0.01
Computing Skinning Decomposition:
    Iter #0: Updating trans..... Done! Updating weights... Done! RMSE = 0.0917716
`

11. Check the RMSE is less than 0.001.

#### Options

Skinning decomposition to generate bone transformations and skinning weights from input meshes sequence

`call #dembones -i="Bone_Geom.fbx" -a="Bone_Anim.abc" -b=20 -o="Decomposition_20.fbx"`

Joint grouping

`call #dembones -i="Bone_Geom.fbx" -a="Bone_Anim.abc" -b=20 --bindUpdate=2 -o="Decomposition_20_grouped.fbx"`

Solve skinning weights from input meshes sequence and input bone transformations

`call #dembones -i="Bone_Trans.fbx" -a="Bone_Anim.abc" --nTransIters=0 -o="SolvedWeights.fbx"`

Solve bone transformations from input meshes sequence and input skinning weights

`call #dembones -i="Bone_Skin.fbx" -a="Bone_Anim.abc" --nWeightsIters=0 -o="SolvedTransformations.fbx"`

Optimize given bone transformations and skinning weights from input meshes sequence

`call #dembones -i="Bone_All.fbx" -a="Bone_Anim.abc" --bindUpdate=1 -o="Optimized.fbx"`

Only solve helper #bone using demLock attribute of the joints

`call #dembones -i="Bone_Helpers.fbx" -a="Bone_Anim.abc" --bindUpdate=1 -o="SolvedHelpers.fbx"`

Partially solve skinning weights using per-vertex color attribute of the mesh

`call #dembones -i="Bone_PartiallySkinned.fbx" -a="Bone_Anim.abc" --nTransIters=0 -o="SolvedPartialWeights.fbx"`

### Open questions:

I align each track to a second? one after the others?

How do I find the tracks again?

## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Better performance
- Able to compose animations

## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

- More #bone

## Option graveyard: <!-- same as above -->

- Option: Status quo
- Rejection Reason: Blend shapes are slow and uncomposable.

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Not a few lines of code to do error bound matching and geometry processing.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

I know how to do this!
