### Context and Problem Statement

Write down how we make branch updates.

### Describe the feature / enhancement and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Need to write down how to do updates.

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams

On the Github UI, go to the mater branch and update from Godot Engine master.

```
git clone https://github.com/V-Sekai/groups_merge_script
cd groups_merge_script
sh update_repos.sh
```

```
git clone https://github.com/V-Sekai/groups-workspace-fire -b 4.x --single-branch --recurse-submodules
cd groups-workspace-fire
# open folder in visual studio code
# use update repositories visual studio code command
```

Not code, but procedure.
