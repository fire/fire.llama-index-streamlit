# Help Us Write About V-Sekai

We aim to create comprehensive documentation for developers and users, covering all significant features and topics. Each feature requires a dedicated page with a descriptive title and a bullet list of essential points the user needs to learn.

## Example Topic: Godot XR

For instance, when writing about Godot XR, the user should learn:

- What is XR? (link to a page or provide a brief explanation)
- What is Godot? (link to a previous page if covered, and briefly re-explain in one sentence)
- How XR works in Godot and how our product utilizes it
- Concrete achievements possible with this feature/knowledge
- Limitations of the technology affecting our product

Draft each page as a bullet list like this, allowing writers to understand the points to cover quickly.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

For cases where users must follow steps, detail each step using straightforward language. Be consistent with verbs and phrasing to minimize cognitive load. For example:

### Changing Game Resolution

1. Open the Project -> Project Settings... menu.
2. Navigate to Display -> Window in the left column. The game's window settings appear on the right.
3. Scroll down to the resolution setting.
4. Click the numbers to change the resolution (values are in pixels).

Consistently use verbs like:

- Click a button
- Open a menu
- Open a file
- Navigate to a tab

Keeping things simple, clear, and consistent makes it easier for users to concentrate on the process and remember new details.
