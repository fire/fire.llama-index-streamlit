VR\n\n\"VRM\" is a file format for handling 3D humanoid avatar (3D model) data for VR applications. It is based on glTF2.0. Anyone is free to use it.\n\n![VRM](https://vrm.dev/en/vrm/vrm_about.html)\n\nVRM is a versatile tool that can handle humanoid character avatars.\n\n- It provides a standard implementation (UniVRM) for reading and writing VRM files in Unity\n  - [Download UniVRM](https://github.com/vrm-c/UniVRM/releases)\n- The format is glTF based, so it\u2019s cross-platform. It can also be handled by other game engines and the Web.\n  - [Learn more about glTF](https://www.khronos.org/gltf/)\n\n## Contents\n\n- VRM is formulated on top of the 3D standard format glTF2.0 to handle the humanoid model. The humanoid motion (e.g. from motion capture) can be reproduced based on defined Humanoid bones in VRM\n\n- Runtime VRM Import: all data including textures and materials is compacted as one file. To import the VRM model into applications, only one single file is needed\n\n- Standard face operations such as emotions, blinks, and aiueo are defined, and you can do the following:\n\n  - Select facial expressions by user operation\n  - Lip sync from voice\n  - Random blink\n  - Assign facial capture\n  - [Learn more about BlendShape](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/BlendShapes.html)\n\n- It supports 3 types of materials (shaders):\n\n  - [PBR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physically_based_rendering)\n  - [Unlit](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/shader-StandardUnlit.html)\n  - [MToon](https://github.com/Santarh/MToon)\n\n- It supports 3 types of line-of-sight control:\n\n  - Gaze by Bone\n  - Gaze by BlendShape\n  - Gaze by TextureUV\n\n- There is a standard implementation of swaying objects that does not depend on the physics engine, such as the character\u2019s hair.\n\n  - [Learn more about SpringBone](https://github.com/vrm-c/UniVRM/blob/master/Assets/VRM/UniVRM/Scripts/SpringBone/README.md)\n\n- Avatar\u2019s first-person view is available in VR\n\n  - [Learn more about FirstPerson](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-Camera.html)\n\n- Despite the Meta information such as Model Title and Author Name, with the advent of the VR era, Thumbnail and License Information are also included in the VRM file.\n  - [Learn more about Meta](https://vrm.dev/en/docs/univrm/meta/)\n\nAs described above, VRM is not just a 3D model data. It is designed for being able to be used right away once being loaded into applications.\n\n## What can you do with VRM?\n\nThe same avatar (VRM model) data can be used in any application that supports VRM. As long as various VRM applications are made, the future will look like the one described below for sure\u2026\n\n- Create your own avatar with the character maker in VRM format\n- Use your own avatar to host a live streaming event and show up on your friends\u2019 live channels\n- After the live streaming, start a VR game to explore the VR world with your own avatar\n- After the game, move to the chat room in the VR world. Use the same avatar character to hang out with friends\n- Tomorrow join the VR study group in VR. Of course, the same avatar appearance\n\nBy using your own avatar (3D model data) in VRM format, you can access various applications and games that support VRM.\n\nLive streaming, video creation, games, chat\u2026. The virtual worlds are not connected with each other. Using VRM is the first step to bridge those virtual worlds\n\n## VRM applications\n\n- [Applications that support VRM](https://vrm.dev/en/vrm_applications/)\n\n## VRM features\n\nIn the past, handling 3D humanoid avatar (3D model) in Virtual Reality, Virtual YouTuber, etc.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "716aaff0-13e4-420d-a1f3-0ecaa866259e": {"__data__": {"id_": "716aaff0-13e4-420d-a1f3-0ecaa866259e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6db1d190-587b-41d5-95f9-f8b871461ffb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "25c36308659af7d620f2cba10c5a264892ff373574406b3a4cc0b28256ea12d3"}, "2": {"node_id": "f21b73ea-35e6-4fa1-9e2f-d1929b8b56ad", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b01d01d93c59e40626c80fde89e78fe379121e0dee18e217eaa633c94861e1e5"}}, "hash": "efda92c02ef65bf6b6384c22040f4bd76e7f45cb650da1adf06c3c8c4a289fb0", "text": "was not trivial as it was necessary to develop unique systems for applications and fine-tune the 3D model data due to:\n\n- The output data is depend on how creators make the 3D model and what modeling tools are used\n\n  - The coordinate system, scale, initial pose, and the way to express expressions are all different\u2026\n  - Needless to say, the way bones put into the 3D model is also different\n  - The initial posture is different (T-Pose, A-Pose, Z + orientation, Z-direction).\n  - The expression method of facial expressions is different (Morph, Bone, identification method).\n  - Needless to say, the way bones put into the 3D model is also different\n\n- Each company has its own specifications for handling the 3D model data, which are way more complex than usual.

We started with a dream to build an open-source VR tech stack using the Godot Engine, a popular open-source game engine. Our goal was not only to contribute to the social VR space but also to provide alternatives to proprietary engines like Unity and Unreal.\n\nWe've worked on many projects for Godot, including support for the VRM virtual character model format, an importer for Unitypackage content, systems for IK and character animation retargeting, more robust networking solutions, a WebAssembly-based scripting engine, improvements to Godot\u2019s VR support, and much more.\n\nOur journey had its challenges. For instance, our booth at Virtual Market 6, one of the world's largest virtual conventions, was removed two days after opening due to alleged violations of VRChat, Inc.\u2019s terms of service. But this setback only strengthened our resolve and highlighted the need for open solutions in the social VR space.\n\nToday, V-Sekai has grown into a global community of open technology enthusiasts who are committed to advancing open standards and open-source software for virtual worlds. We continue to welcome others who share our values to join us and contribute to the future of open-source VR technology.\n\n## Participate\n\n1. **Chat**: On [Discord](https://discord.gg/7BQDHesck8).\n3. **Visit**: [v-sekai.org](https://v-sekai.org).\n4. **Follow**: Us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/VSekaiOfficial).\n5. **Contribute**: On GitHub [here](https://github.com/V-Sekai).\n6. **Track**: Proposals [here](https://github.com/V-Sekai/manuals/issues).\n7. **Organize**: Issues [here](https://github.com/V-Sekai/v-sekai-game/issues).\n8. **Contact**: SaracenOne, Lyuma, or Fire.\n\n# Meetings\n\nOur meetings are ad-hoc and not recorded.

This can be achieved by using the T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) model with JSON-former for XState in Godot Engine 4.0.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nThe proposed solution involves using the T5 model to generate text based on input text and then converting the generated text into XState JSON format, all within the Godot Engine 4.0 environment.\n\n## Implementation\n\nTo use T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) with JSON-former for XState in Godot Engine 4.0, you'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Load the necessary libraries**\n\n```gd\nvar transformers = preload(\"res://path/to/transformers.gd\")\nvar torch = preload(\"res://path/to/torch.gd\")\n```\n\n2. **Load the T5 model and tokenizer**\n\n```gd\nvar model_name = \"t5-small\"\nvar tokenizer = transformers.load_T5Tokenizer(model_name)\nvar model = transformers.load_T5ForConditionalGeneration(model_name)\n```\n\n3. **Create a function to generate text using T5**\n\n```gd\nfunc generate_text(input_text: String) -> String:\n    var input_ids = tokenizer.encode(input_text)\n    var outputs = model.generate(input_ids)\n    var generated_text = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0])\n    return generated_text\n```\n\n4. **Create a function to replace placeholders in T5 output**\n\n```gd\nfunc replace_placeholders(text: String) -> String:\n    var formatted_text = text.replace(\"<extra_id_0>\", \"event\").replace(\"<extra_id_1>\", \"state\")\n    return formatted_text\n```\n\n5. **Create a function to parse JSON from formatted text**\n\n```gd\nfunc parse_JSON(formatted_text: String) -> Dictionary:\n    var json_object = JSON.parse(formatted_text).result\n    return json_object\n```\n\n6. **Create a function to convert T5 output to XState JSON format**\n\n```gd\nfunc t5_to_jsonformer_xstate(text: String) -> Dictionary:\n    var formatted_text = replace_placeholders(text)\n    var json_object = parse_JSON(formatted_text)\n    return json_object\n```\n\n7. **Use the functions to generate XState JSON**\n\n```gd\nfunc _ready():\n    var input_text = \"your input text here\"\n    var t5_output = generate_text(input_text)\n    var xstate_json = t5_to_jsonformer_xstate(t5_output)\n    print(xstate_json)\n```\n\nThis will give you the XState JSON format for the given input text. Note that the T5 model might need to be fine-tuned on a dataset specific to your use case to generate accurate XState JSON representations.\n\n## Positive Consequences\n\n- Automates the process of converting natural language text into XState JSON format within the Godot Engine 4.0 environment.\n- Reduces manual effort and potential errors in creating XState JSON representations.\n\n## Negative Consequences\n\n- The T5 model may require fine-tuning on a specific dataset to generate accurate XState JSON representations.\n- There might be limitations in understanding complex or ambiguous input text.\n\n## Option graveyard\n\nHere are some option graveyard items for the proposal:\n\n1. **Using rule-based natural language processing (NLP) techniques**\n\n   -

May incur additional costs or usage limitations.\n\nThese options were considered but ultimately discarded in favor of using the T5 model with JSON-former for XState in Godot Engine 4.0 due to its balance of performance, ease of implementation, and adaptability to the specific task.\n\n## If this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nThe proposed solution requires more than a few lines of script and involves using a pre-trained model (T5) to generate the desired output within the Godot Engine 4.0 environment.\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nImplementing this solution as part of the core functionality can help V-Sekai users automate the process of generating XState JSON representations from natural language text within the Godot Engine 4.0 environment, improving efficiency and reducing manual effort.\n\n## References\n\n- [V-Sekai](https://v-sekai.org/)\n- [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/)\n- [GDScript documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_basics.html)\n- [T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683)\n- [Transformers library](https://huggingface.co/transformers/)\n- [XState documentation](https://xstate.js.org/docs/)", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c2fbfd12-f560-422a-a809-4e6fa90674e8": {"__data__": {"id_": "c2fbfd12-f560-422a-a809-4e6fa90674e8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "920541ed-f85e-472e-9826-91407d4fdfdf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "095297a71334566242644bebb1b14d01e2ae13add4d98ab32d07ceb316e6a237"}}, "hash": "cd65ceeaec63b3fd998fc3f8cba85b0940377df3499437fc60190e49d266ea66", "text": "#  Procedurally create variations for our props, environments and avatars\n### Metadata\n\n- Status: proposed <!-- draft | proposed | rejected | accepted | deprecated | superseded by -->\n- Deciders: V-Sekai,fire,\n- Tags: V-Sekai,chatgp4,\n\n### Context and Problem Statement\n\nLack of variety and customization in V-Sekai's 3D props, environments, and avatars.\n\n### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nIntroducing a procedural generator for 3D props, environments, and avatars in V-Sekai will significantly enhance user experience by offering a broad range of customizable options. Procedural generation is an algorithmic method of content creation that replaces manual design, resulting in a larger array of unique combinations.\n\nThe procedural generator can be developed using a mix of algorithms, libraries, and assets to produce a vast assortment of variations for props, environments, and avatars. Users' input parameters, such as prop type, color, size, and material, will guide the generator in crafting distinctive content.\n\n### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n  A[Prop Type] --> B(Select Base Model)\n  A[Prop Type] --> C(Apply Procedural Variations)\n  A[Prop Type] --> D(Combine Variations)\n  B --> E(Base Model)\n  C --> F(Shape Variation)\n  C --> G(Color Variation)\n  C --> H(Texture Variation)\n  F --> I(Combined Variations)\n  G --> I(Combined Variations)\n  H --> I(Combined Variations)\n  E --> I(Combined Variations)\n  I --> J(Final Output)\n```\n\nThis flowchart demonstrates the procedural generation process using the following steps:\n\n1. User Input Parameters: Users provide their preferences for prop type, color, size, and material.\n2. Select Base Model: The generator selects a base model corresponding to the chosen prop type.\n3. Apply Procedural Variations: The generator applies algorithmic variations to the base model, modifying its shape, color, and texture based on user input.\n4. Combine Variations: The generator combines these variations to create a unique prop with the specified properties.\n5. Generate Unique Prop, Environment, or Avatar: The final output is a unique prop, environment, or avatar that meets the user's preferences.\n\nThis approach increases the variety and customization options in V-Sekai, enhancing the platform's appeal and offering a more engaging experience for users.\n\n### Positive Consequences\n\n1. Enhanced variety: Procedural generation enables a wide array of unique content, delivering a diverse and constantly evolving experience for users.\n2. User personalization: By incorporating user preferences, the generator can produce content that aligns with individual tastes and needs.\n3. Efficient resource utilization: Procedural content generation minimizes the need for manual design and asset creation, leading to a more cost-effective platform.\n\n### Negative Consequences\n\n1. Complexity: Developing a procedural generator can be intricate, necessitating expertise in algorithms, 3D modeling, and other technical domains.\n2. Performance impact: Real-time content generation might affect performance, particularly if algorithms are not optimized or if the platform experiences high user traffic.\n\n### Option graveyard\n\nDo nothing.\n\n### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nThis is a few lines of code.\n\n### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nWe care about v-sekai more than others.\n\n### References\n\n- [V-Sekai](https://v-sekai.org/)", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ea375fad-8f5b-4f91-a41a-204f9ebd2dc5": {"__data__": {"id_": "ea375fad-8f5b-4f91-a41a-204f9ebd2dc5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "26151c8f-5a86-4cb1-8bac-cbf123de8deb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a03597f567d0e92ccb1e8824b6f3bb496b0981b6120f113cc6401f8123665101"}}, "hash": "49574effd697778d488e51bf6db133337a0efcab993636dd93b6df6111e61abf", "text": "# Better Godot Engine integration with Blender with gltf extensions\n\n### Context and Problem Statement\n\nIntegration between blender and Godot Engine could be better.\n\n### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nThe import of Godot Shaders to Godot Engine can help developers and developer artists workflows.\n\n### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\n\nWrite a design for embed the Godot shader and material information in the exported GLTF as an extension, then parse it in the Godot importer \n\n### Positive Consequences\n\nEasier to use Godot Engine\n\n### Negative Consequences\n\nThe Godot Engine shader definition may change\n\n### Option graveyard\n\nStatus quo.\n\nCan we do nothing?\n\n### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nThis is probably a folder of python scripts.\n\n### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nWe manage the Godot Engine import experience.\n\n### References\n\n- [V-Sekai](https://v-sekai.org/)\n\n\n### License of the contribution\n\nCopyright (c) 2022-present K.

This requires sampling a chaotic 7-dimensional space every frame, either through precomputation or real-time processing. The complexity arises from the fact that sound behaves more like light with intense diffraction, making it impossible to rasterize.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nImplement Feedback Delay Networks (FDNs) for artificial reverberation. FDNs consist of multiple delay lines connected in a feedback loop with a mixing matrix. The output is a combination of the input signal and the delayed signals.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. Choose the number of delay lines and their lengths based on the desired reverberation time and room characteristics.\n2. Implement a mixing matrix to control the energy distribution between the delay lines.\n3. Create a feedback loop by connecting the outputs of the delay lines to the inputs through the mixing matrix.\n4. Combine the input signal with the delayed signals to produce the reverberated output.\n\n## Implementation\n\n```gdscript\nclass_name FDN\nextends Node\n\nvar num_delay_lines : int\nvar delay_lines : Array\nvar mixing_matrix : Array\nvar room_characteristics : Dictionary\n\nfunc _init(num_delay_lines: int, delay_lengths: Array, mixing_matrix: Array, room_characteristics: Dictionary):\n    self.num_delay_lines = num_delay_lines\n    self.delay_lines = []\n    for length in delay_lengths:\n        self.delay_lines.append(DelayLine.new(length))\n    self.mixing_matrix = mixing_matrix\n    self.room_characteristics = room_characteristics\n\nfunc process(input_signal: float) -> float:\n    # Step 1: Calculate the output of each delay line\n    var delay_outputs = []\n    for dl in self.delay_lines:\n        delay_outputs.append(dl.process(input_signal))\n\n    # Step 2: Apply the room characteristics to the delay line outputs\n    var processed_outputs = apply_room_characteristics(delay_outputs)\n\n    # Step 3: Apply the mixing matrix to the processed delay line outputs\n    var mixed_outputs = apply_mixing_matrix(processed_outputs)\n\n    # Step 4: Update the delay lines with the mixed outputs\n    for i in range(self.num_delay_lines):\n        self.delay_lines[i].update(mixed_outputs[i])\n\n    # Step 5: Combine the input signal with the delayed signals\n    var output_signal = input_signal + sum(mixed_outputs)\n    return output_signal\n\nfunc apply_room_characteristics(delay_outputs: Array) -> Array:\n    var processed_outputs = []\n    for i in range(len(delay_outputs)):\n        processed_output = delay_outputs[i] * room_characteristics[\"absorption\"][i]\n        processed_outputs.append(processed_output)\n    return processed_outputs\n\nfunc apply_mixing_matrix(delay_outputs: Array) -> Array:\n    # TODO: Implement the mixing matrix application logic\n    pass\n```\n\n## Positive Consequences\n\n- Improved audio reverb simulation\n- More realistic sound propagation and interaction within environments\n- Smarter estimation of long reverb times\n\n## Negative Consequences\n\n- Increased computational complexity\n- Potential performance impact on real-time processing\n\n## Option graveyard\n\n* Generalized Dijkstra Pathfinding\n* DWN (Digital Waveguide Network): A method for simulating audio reverb by modeling sound propagation as waves traveling along waveguides with bidirectional delay lines and scattering junctions.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ce155d14-9946-4e6f-9cc3-8716315efe6a": {"__data__": {"id_": "ce155d14-9946-4e6f-9cc3-8716315efe6a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d9d65901-c8fe-4420-aad0-3c2bb2a0f4b7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f3c3d147b0a25d8b2783fc8bf0093cd6f7531ed1635d4cbd74f8b78025c8f991"}, "2": {"node_id": "5d52bf87-42fa-4fdd-966b-fcae2035df12", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d5a90c986bdca1dd15befba69fbd925e68618854a0c73dab02fd903e94276d39"}, "3": {"node_id": "fce4c08d-9cd8-4dbe-8665-5f50702dbe89", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "203f00b6b9e9e3d134053e1941925ffde1032b58108161487a4bca31c40fcc72"}}, "hash": "c0e1953bcd21cf1967cd744e19c1462489809460febc457d5980a3f6a652583c", "text": "* Ray tracing can be used to simulate sound propagation in 3D environments.

We will analyze the computational and I/O complexity involved in this specific case.\n\n### FDN reverb claims may need to be verified\n\n1. For a medium-quality reverb effect, let's consider using 8 delay lines in the FDN.\n2. For an 8x8 matrix, there are 64 multiplications and 56 additions required for each sample.\n3. Overall, the computational complexity for a medium-quality reverb effect with 8 delay lines is manageable for most modern CPUs and can be efficiently processed in real-time.\n4. In summary, implementing a medium-quality reverb effect using an FDN with 8 delay lines has a manageable computational and I/O complexity, making it suitable for real-time processing on most modern hardware.\n\n### Computational Complexity\n\nFor a medium-quality reverb effect, let's consider using 8 delay lines in the FDN. The main components contributing to the computational complexity are:\n\n1. **Delay Lines**: Each delay line requires memory for storing the delayed samples and computations for updating the delay buffer. For 8 delay lines, the complexity scales linearly with the number of delay lines.\n\n2. **Matrix Mixing**: The mixing matrix combines the outputs of the delay lines in a specific way to create the desired reverb effect. For an 8x8 matrix, there are 64 multiplications and 56 additions required for each sample.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fce4c08d-9cd8-4dbe-8665-5f50702dbe89": {"__data__": {"id_": "fce4c08d-9cd8-4dbe-8665-5f50702dbe89", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d9d65901-c8fe-4420-aad0-3c2bb2a0f4b7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f3c3d147b0a25d8b2783fc8bf0093cd6f7531ed1635d4cbd74f8b78025c8f991"}, "2": {"node_id": "ce155d14-9946-4e6f-9cc3-8716315efe6a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c0e1953bcd21cf1967cd744e19c1462489809460febc457d5980a3f6a652583c"}}, "hash": "203f00b6b9e9e3d134053e1941925ffde1032b58108161487a4bca31c40fcc72", "text": "3. **Feedback and Input/Output Processing**: Additional processing, such as filtering or gain adjustments, may be applied to the input, output, or feedback paths. This complexity depends on the specific filters or processing used but is generally proportional to the number of delay lines.\n\nOverall, the computational complexity for a medium-quality reverb effect with 8 delay lines is manageable for most modern CPUs and can be efficiently processed in real-time.\n\n### I/O Complexity\n\nThe I/O complexity refers to the amount of data that needs to be read from and written to memory during the processing of the reverb effect. In the case of an FDN with 8 delay lines, the I/O complexity is mainly determined by:\n\n1. **Reading and Writing Delay Line Buffers**: Each delay line requires reading and writing operations for updating the delay buffer. The I/O complexity scales linearly with the number of delay lines.\n\n2. **Input and Output Audio Data**: The audio input data must be read, processed, and combined with the output of the FDN to generate the final reverberated audio signal. The I/O complexity for input and output audio data is generally low compared to the delay line buffer operations.\n\nIn summary, implementing a medium-quality reverb effect using an FDN with 8 delay lines has a manageable computational and I/O complexity, making it suitable for real-time processing on most modern hardware.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "62f37924-14c5-4394-88c3-6d0e258ebb0c": {"__data__": {"id_": "62f37924-14c5-4394-88c3-6d0e258ebb0c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0ed32b93-eee9-44e8-bfb3-ec65cbc6c073", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "18687fdd9294ab9960ecdd6c210c3b5aa934f18dd90426092dc535ff5e817711"}}, "hash": "57c8b9c5ca23a0b0173129a5faa60ef643195baf3681952d2f3423110c2bf318", "text": "# Phase out groups in the branding to make it more recognizable\n\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\nNeed to find recognizable brands.\n\n## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nPhase out the 'groups' terminology as much as possible because it was too generic and can easily get mixed up with other things.\n\n## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\n\nReplace vsk_default for the groups in the Godot project.\n\n## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- [e.g., improvement of quality attribute satisfaction, follow-up decisions required, \u2026]\n- [\u2026]\n\n## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- [e.g., compromising quality attribute, follow-up decisions required, \u2026]\n- [\u2026]\n\n[this section can be repeated for each option if more than one option is open for consideration]\n\n## Option graveyard: <!-- same as above -->\n\n- Option:\n<!-- [List the proposed options no longer open for consideration.] -->\n- Rejection Reason:\n<!-- [List the reasons for the rejection: (the Bad traits)] -->\n\n## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nNot a script.\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nWe use the groups branding.\n\n## References <!-- optional -->\n\n- [Link type](link to adr) <!-- example: Refined by [xxx](yyyymmdd-xxx.md) -->\n- \u2026 <!-- numbers of links can vary -->\n\n## Derivative License\n\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

How can we prioritize the placement of a limited number of trackers to ensure a realistic and immersive experience for both activities?\n\n### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nThe proposed option involves prioritizing tracker placement for the head, hands, hips, and feet, as they are essential for both soccer and dancing experiences. This approach allows for an effective trade-off between tracking accuracy and budget constraints while ensuring a satisfactory level of immersion in both activities.\n\n### Describe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\n\n**VR Tracker USB dongles need line of sight.**\n\n1. Head: At the base of the neck to monitor head rotation and tilt.\n2. Left Hand: On the left wrist to track the overall motion of the left hand.\n3. Right Hand: On the right wrist to track the overall motion of the right hand.\n4. Hips: A tracker on the hips to monitor lower body movement. Placed behind the body.\n5. Left Foot: A tracker on the left foot to capture left foot movement, essential for both soccer and dancing.\n6. Right Foot: A tracker on the right foot to capture right foot movement, also crucial for both activities.\n\nAs the budget permits, additional trackers can be incorporated into the setup to further enhance tracking accuracy, particularly for the upper body and leg movements. This expansion can be achieved by following the prioritized list of additional trackers below:\n\n7. Chest: A tracker on the chest to monitor upper body rotation, providing more detailed information about the user's torso movements.\n8. Left Elbow: Attach a tracker to the left elbow to monitor its angle, speed, and position. This helps improve the accuracy of tracking arm movements during activities like soccer and dancing.\n9. Right Elbow: In the same way, place a tracker on the right elbow to keep track of its angle, speed, and position. This also enhances the precision of tracking arm movements in sports such as soccer and dance performances.\n\nBy gradually adding these trackers to the initial setup, the overall tracking accuracy of the system will be improved. This will result in more natural and immersive interactions within the VR environment, leading to a more satisfying user experience for both soccer and dancing activities.\n\n### Positive Consequences\n\n- Effective use of a limited budget while maintaining immersive experiences.\n- The solution caters to both soccer and dancing activities in VR.\n- Flexibility in adding more trackers as budget permits.\n\n### Negative Consequences\n\n- Reduced tracking accuracy for upper body and leg movements compared to a setup with more trackers.\n- Potential limitations in supporting advanced features or interactions in VR.\n\n### Option graveyard\n\nCamera-based tracking: Utilizing external cameras to track body movements without the need for wearable trackers. While this approach can be cost-effective, it may not provide the same level of accuracy and precision as wearable trackers, particularly for fast and complex movements in soccer and dancing. Additionally, camera-based tracking can be sensitive to lighting conditions and may require a specific setup to function optimally.\n\nCamera-based tracking might be a viable solution if budget constraints are severe, but it is essential to consider the potential trade-offs in terms of tracking accuracy and reliability compared to wearable trackers.\n\n### If this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nNo, as the proposed solution deals with hardware configuration and the strategic placement of physical trackers to balance budget and immersion.\n\n### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nYes, ensuring an immersive VR experience with a limited budget is a fundamental challenge that requires expertise in tracker placement and prioritization.\n\n### References\n\n- [V-Sekai](https://v-sekai.org/)", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d9242591-b94d-436c-af5b-fdaf48606d4e": {"__data__": {"id_": "d9242591-b94d-436c-af5b-fdaf48606d4e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ef7c76b4-7fbd-48fc-b414-b9c90df073ce", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "37b02ff095b903db416c4fd8869b6a2d30624dadbdfb826f531171a28c2310c0"}}, "hash": "5d962ba44d1d4e953c5326cd78839b51abec3586cc9c751059c6727de70617c5", "text": "# Challenges in managing and synchronizing multiple assets and libraries across different git repositories\n\n### Metadata\n\n- Status: accepted <!-- draft | proposed | rejected | accepted | deprecated | superseded by -->\n- Deciders: V-Sekai,fire\n- Tags: V-Sekai,chatgpt4 summary,\n\n### Context and Problem Statement\n\nV-Sekai projects currently face challenges in managing and synchronizing multiple assets and libraries across different branches.

To boost its functionality and compatibility with other tools, we propose integrating networked procedural generation as a sidecar to the Godot engine server, allowing for more dynamic and immersive environments in V-Sekai.\n\nTo further address V-Sekai's limitations, we suggest incorporating the Membrane Framework along with other relevant technologies such as Godot Engine, OpenMfx Support, Elixir Phoenix, and Elixir Nx. This comprehensive integration will not only enhance V-Sekai's capabilities but also increase its versatility across various use cases.\n\nThe implementation involves connecting V-Sekai with the components mentioned in the Membrane Framework diagram below:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant MembraneFramework\n  participant WebAndGodotEngineAndBlenderClient\n  participant ElixirNx\n  participant AIMLFramework\n  participant Yugabyte\n\n  rect rgb(240, 248, 255)\n    note over MembraneFramework, Yugabyte: Toggle Actions\n    MembraneFramework->>WebAndGodotEngineAndBlenderClient: TOGGLE_GAME_ENGINE_AND_CLIENTS\n    MembraneFramework->>ElixirNx: ACCELERATE_MEMBRANE_FRAMEWORK\n    MembraneFramework->>AIMLFramework: TOGGLE_AIML_FRAMEWORK\n    MembraneFramework->>Yugabyte: TOGGLE_YUGABYTE\n  end\n\n  box \"Source\" #CCFFCC\n    participant MembraneFramework\n    participant WebAndGodotEngineAndBlenderClient\n  end\n\n  box \"Filter\" #FFFFCC\n    participant ElixirNx\n    participant AIMLFramework\n  end\n\n  box \"Sink & Source of Data\" #FFCCCC\n    participant Yugabyte\n  end\n```\n\n### Using Read Replicas\n\nWe propose using read replicas for applications needing single-zone writes and multi-region reads. Benefits include:\n\n- **Resilience**: Zone-level resilience with primary cluster nodes across multiple zones.\n- **Consistency**: Timeline consistency in replica clusters, better than eventual consistency.\n- **Latency**: Quick reads from primary and replica clusters; write latency depends on client-primary cluster distance.\n\n## Positive Consequences\n\n- Improved functionality and versatility of V-Sekai\n- Enhanced compatibility with other tools and platforms\n- Greater potential for collaboration and community involvement\n\n## Negative Consequences\n\n- Increased complexity in implementation and maintenance\n- Potential performance overhead due to integration of multiple components\n\n## Option Graveyard\n\n1. **Standalone procedural generation**: Implementing procedural generation as a standalone feature without integrating it with the Godot Engine server. This option was discarded because it would not provide the same level of compatibility and versatility as the proposed solution.\n\n2. **Using pre-built assets**: Relying on pre-built assets for creating environments instead of implementing networked procedural generation.

This is important for a few reasons:\n\n- The current host may disappear or the physical hardware could break (as it is not in a cloud)\n- Part of our project's purpose is to allow anyone to fork the project or run their own version V-Sekai however they want.\n- As a use for \"staging\" or testing changes to infrastructure.\n- As a means for replicating live data such as CDN content, metadata or other databases. (some assets may depend on other assets in the future)\n\n## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\n1. Run TrueNAS Scale in DigitalOcean (Droplet/standalone VM, not kubernetes).\n2. (It should be possible in other cloud providers, and on own infrastructure, but we will pick this environment to focus on)\n3. Write TrueNAS Scale charts for gocd; cockroachdb; uro\n4. LetsEncrypt certs require open port 443 or 80 for http01; or any dns01 provider using a plugin.\n5. TrueNAS Scale supports backups and snapshots.\n\n## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\n\n- Create new droplet. (Minimum configuration????):\n  - Custom Image -> pick our TrueNAS image or some custom one we make.\n  - Basic: pick a number of cpus. Direct storage is only used for the OS.\n  - Add a block volume for $10. TrueNAS requires a separate block device.\n  - Do not enable backups because TrueNAS has its own backup systems.\n- Add one extra block volume after the machine spins up to get redundancy (RAID-1?)\n- (Note that block volumes can be moved between VMs, so doing things this way gives pretty good redudancy.\n\n## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- Giving people many ways to remix, host or fork our work is part of our mission.\n- It will give us a way to quickly spin up redundant infrastructure in the cloud, either if a disaster happens or we want to scale.\n\n## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- Supporting more configurations will take more time from us.\n\n[this section can be repeated for each option if more than one option is open for consideration]\n\n## Option graveyard: <!-- same as above -->\n\n- Option: Support only bare metal infrastructure\n- Rejection Reason: This is not ideal unless you are at scale, because bare metal can die and cannot scale.\n\n## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nThis project is to document what the script will be\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nInfra is part of our mission.\n\n## References <!-- optional and numbers of links can vary -->\n\n- https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/volumes/how-to/move-between-droplets/\n\n## Derivative License\n\nCopyright (c) 2022 V-Sekai contributors.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Utilize the Vulkan backend to run an image superresolution demo that generates 4x larger images. IREE is an MLIR-based end-to-end compiler and runtime that lowers Machine Learning (ML) models to a unified IR, allowing for better performance and scaling.\n\n### Describe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\n\n1. Compile IREE as a C++ GDExtension for Godot Engine 4.0.\n2. Use the Vulkan backend to run the image superresolution demo.\n3. Load and process ML models for image superresolution using IREE.\n4. Integrate the resulting functionality into V-Sekai's existing image processing pipeline.\n\n### Positive Consequences\n\n- Allow image superresolution in V-Sekai.\n- Enhanced performance due to IREE's efficient MLIR-based compiler and runtime.\n- Scalable solution that adapts to various hardware and software constraints. Not only NVIDIA, but ARM, Intel, AMD and Apple gpus.\n- Allow using other machine learning models from PyTorch and Tensorflow\n\n### Negative Consequences\n\n- Additional development time required for integration and optimization.\n- Potential trade-offs in implementing other features.\n\n### Option graveyard\n\n1. Use a custom script to work around the image superresolution issue.\n   - This might not provide a scalable or high-performance solution.\n2. Implement a different image superresolution algorithm.\n   - This could lead to suboptimal results compared to IREE's capabilities.\n\n### If this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nA custom script could serve as a workaround for infrequent use of image superresolution, but it may have drawbacks in terms of efficiency, output quality, and maintenance efforts. If the feature aligns with V-Sekai's goals and significantly improves user experience, integrating the IREE-based solution into the core might be more effective.\n\n### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nIn summary, integrating the IREE-based image superresolution feature into V-Sekai's core offers several benefits, including an enhanced user experience, performance optimization, alignment with open source values, and easier maintenance and support. These advantages contribute to a better, more immersive VR experience while staying true to V-Sekai's project goals.\n\n### References\n\n- V-Sekai: https://v-sekai.org/\n- IREE (Intermediate Representation Execution Environment): https://github.com/openxla/iree\n- Godot Engine: https://godotengine.org\n- Vulkan Backend: https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/\n- IREE.gd: https://github.com/RechieKho/IREE.gd", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e1e5c353-a2ea-4203-bd4d-a0882c48be2d": {"__data__": {"id_": "e1e5c353-a2ea-4203-bd4d-a0882c48be2d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a365ccbb-9e4d-486c-b108-67c4824551d9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "aeb909827388ef94bcdd330be86d48ec4465c6b53e159ddfab3d77544846714b"}}, "hash": "5ba1fe941521e5bf442095d9dbf4e274bc4816d7d969d2e8268fdc855ec3561c", "text": "# Portable #world Content\n\n### Context and Problem Statement\n\nIndependent meta-verses (virtual worlds) lack content because their communities are too small to fund much content work.\n\n### Describe the feature / enhancement and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nCollaborate with Mozilla Hub's Spoke Editor and OMI Group's glTF2 extensions to have portable #world content.\n\n### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams\n\nProvide basic glTF2 extensions.

This causes issues with Alicia's hips-spine angle.\n\n## Solution\n\nWe suggest a new conversion method. It keeps the original bone hierarchy and translates bone names from Japanese to English. This avoids problems caused by changing the hierarchy.\n\n## Changes\n\n1. Original hierarchy (Japanese names):\n   ```\n   Center (\u30bb\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc)\n   \u251c UpperBody (\u4e0a\u534a\u8eab)\n   \u2514 LowerBody (\u4e0b\u534a\u8eab)\n   ```\n\n2. New method, same hierarchy, translated names:\n   ```\n   Center (Hips)\n   \u251c UpperBody (Spine)\n   \u2514 LowerBody (Legs)\n   ```\n\n3. After the second conversion, the hierarchy changes:\n   ```\n   Hips (LowerBody)\n   \u2514 Spine (UpperBody)\n   ```\n\nThis solution keeps the right hips-spine angle for Alicia.\n\n## Good Outcomes\n\n- Keeps the original bone hierarchy, avoiding animation issues.\n- Translates bone names to English, helping non-Japanese speakers.\n\n## Bad Outcomes\n\n- Might need more time to create the new method.\n\n## Other Options\n\n- Changing the hierarchy during conversion caused the problem.\n\n## Can it be fixed with a script?\n\nNo, this needs a new method in the bone hierarchy conversion process.\n\n## Should we do it?\n\nYes, it affects character animations and user experience with V-Sekai models.\n\n## References\n\n- [V-Sekai](https://v-sekai.org/)", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2e401188-720e-4ccd-aee0-32bd47d45c61": {"__data__": {"id_": "2e401188-720e-4ccd-aee0-32bd47d45c61", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "24c28a0e-df0e-4043-a29f-47fc0be2f6c7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5c9c8f3b692c9a727b623096d1b10864fcc4d67be5002d7cc94e7f38e1643251"}}, "hash": "38ce5092b5936d213bf0ca8aef312caf130f9eb516845494cd349b768bc6d022", "text": "# Use Markdown Architectural Decision Records\n\n- Status: accepted\n- Date: 2021-02-11\n- Tags: doc\n\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\nWe want to record architectural decisions made in this project.\nWhich format and structure should these records follow?\n\n## Considered Options\n\n- [MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/) 2.1.2 with Log4brains patch\n- [MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/) 2.1.2 \u2013 The original Markdown Architectural Decision Records\n- [Michael Nygard's template](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions) \u2013 The first incarnation of the term \"ADR\"\n- [Sustainable Architectural Decisions](https://www.infoq.com/articles/sustainable-architectural-design-decisions) \u2013 The Y-Statements\n- Other templates listed at <https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record>\n- Formless \u2013 No conventions for file format and structure\n\n## Decision Outcome\n\nChosen option: \"MADR 2.1.2 with Log4brains patch\", because\n\n- Implicit assumptions should be made explicit.\n  Design documentation is important to enable people understanding the decisions later on.\n  See also [A rational design process: How and why to fake it](https://doi.org/10.1109/TSE.1986.6312940).\n- The MADR format is lean and fits our development style.\n- The MADR structure is comprehensible and facilitates usage & maintenance.\n- The MADR project is vivid.\n- Version 2.1.2 is the latest one available when starting to document ADRs.\n- The Log4brains patch adds more features, like tags.\n\nThe \"Log4brains patch\" performs the following modifications to the original template:\n\n- Change the ADR filenames format (`NNN-adr-name` becomes `YYYYMMDD-adr-name`), to avoid conflicts during Git merges.\n- Add a `draft` status, to enable collaborative writing.\n- Add a `Tags` field.\n\n## References\n\n- Relates to [Use Log4brains to manage the ADRs](20210212-use-log4brains-to-manage-the-adrs.md)\n\n## Derivative License\n\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

This can address these limitations and improve the overall functionality.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n1. Reimplement the IK system as an animation node to gain better control over the processing order, ensure accurate pose states.\n2. Reuse the track filtering code that exists in the AnimationTree system to enhance the new IK system's capabilities.\n\n## Implementation\n\nIn order to improve the Inverse Kinematics (IK) system, we will replace SkeletonIK3D with a new custom AnimationNode called `IKAnimationNode`. This new node will ensure accurate pose states and provide precise control over the IK system.\n\nTo enhance the blending between animations and handle IK more efficiently, we will reuse track filtering code from the existing AnimationTree. This will allow for smoother transitions and better performance.\n\nNext, we will implement the IK solver within the new `IKAnimationNode`. This solver will be responsible for calculating target positions and rotations for each bone in the skeleton.\n\nAfter implementing the IK solver, we will update the AnimationTree to use the new `IKAnimationNode`. This will involve adding an empty track, reading from the transform's position, and blending between different animations to create seamless motion.\n\nAs we develop this new IK system, it is crucial to address potential issues such as filter usability, duplicate subtrees versus multiple outputs, and designing a reasonable full body setup. This includes handling jumping and foot IK interactions with the ground.\n\nFinally, we will test and optimize the new IK system to ensure correct functionality and optimal performance. This will result in a more robust and efficient IK solution for our animation needs.\n\n## Positive Consequences\n\n- Improved control over the processing order of the IK system.\n- Accurate pose states for better animation quality.\n- Potential performance improvements by executing the animation tree outside of the main thread.\n- Enhanced capabilities of the new IK system by reusing the track filtering code.\n\n## Negative Consequences\n\n- Increased complexity in the animation system.\n- Possible compatibility issues with existing projects.\n\n## Option graveyard\n\n1. Keeping the current SkeletonIK3D node and trying to improve its functionality.\n2. Implementing a custom IK solver without reusing the track filtering code from the AnimationTree system.\n3. Using third-party IK solvers instead of developing an in-house solution.\n\n## If this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nNo, the enhancement involves a significant change in the IK system's implementation and cannot be easily worked around with a script.\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nYes, addressing the limitations of the current IK system is crucial for improving V-Sekai's functionality and providing a better experience for users.\n\n## References\n\n- [V-Sekai](https://v-sekai.org/)\n- ManyBoneIK3D (mentioned for reference purposes only)", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8c61c256-bf57-4838-ab08-93bc74afbd1a": {"__data__": {"id_": "8c61c256-bf57-4838-ab08-93bc74afbd1a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6a5606a5-df92-4813-8e2b-7534e117aa75", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "16e5ab9b7ee7d3c68386a7092d001b805fd7e4aefef307a7df740c0f63f5e106"}}, "hash": "be14ca02fdd20b89261aa0d556a010c92aa386af666d662c3ec499590e844ecd", "text": "# V-Sekai Database Solution for 50,000 Concurrent Online Users\n\n## Metadata\n\n- Status: rejected\n- Deciders: V-Sekai, fire\n- Tags: V-Sekai, llm summarization\n\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\nV-Sekai is currently facing a decision on which database solution to use for their project that can handle the load of 50,000 concurrent online users. The options being considered are [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/), [SQLite on FoundationDB](https://forums.foundationdb.org/t/mvsqlite-distributed-mvcc-sqlite-that-runs-on-foundationdb/3493), or [YugabyteDB](https://docs.yugabyte.com/stable/api/ysql/datatypes/). Each option has its own set of advantages and disadvantages, and the team needs to determine which one best fits their requirements.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nBased on the discussion, it seems that YugabyteDB might be a suitable choice for V-Sekai's needs. It offers a single-node setup with the potential for growth, supports a wide range of data types, and provides externally consistent transaction levels. Additionally, YugabyteDB appears to be more compatible with the existing schema compared to SQLite.\n\n## Implementation\n\nTo implement YugabyteDB as the chosen database solution, the following steps should be taken:\n\n1. Evaluate YugabyteDB's compatibility with the existing schema and identify any necessary adjustments.\n2. Set up a single-node YugabyteDB instance for initial development and testing.\n3.

However, VRM 1.0 is a new revision that we need to implement. A key feature of this new revision is the ability to export VRM 1.0 files. Additionally, we also need to publish our implementation to the Godot Engine asset library.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n### Steps\n\n1. Analyze the current implementation of the VRM standard in our system.\n2. Understand the changes and enhancements introduced in VRM 1.0.\n3. Plan the implementation of VRM 1.0 support, including the export feature.\n4. Implement the planned features and changes.\n5. Test the newly implemented VRM 1.0 support in different scenarios.\n6. Prepare the implementation for publishing to the Godot Engine asset library.\n7. Publish the implementation to the Godot Engine asset library.\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe implementation details will be decided upon acceptance of this proposal.\n\n## Positive Consequences\n\n- Enhanced avatar functionality with VRM 1.0 support.\n- Ability to export VRM 1.0 files, increasing compatibility with other systems.\n- Staying up-to-date with the latest standards in the industry.\n- Increased visibility and usage through publishing to the Godot Engine asset library.\n\n## Negative Consequences\n\n- Requires understanding of the new VRM 1.0 standard.\n- Potential increase in development time due to the complexity of implementing a new standard and preparing it for publishing.\n- Need to maintain the published asset in the Godot Engine asset library.\n\n## Option Graveyard\n\nThis section will be filled as we explore different options and discard those that are not feasible or effective.\n\n## If this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nGiven the complexity of implementing a new standard like VRM 1.0 and publishing it to the Godot Engine asset library, it cannot be simply worked around with a few lines of script.\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nImplementing VRM 1.0 support and publishing it to the Godot Engine asset library is crucial for staying competitive and relevant in the industry. It also aligns with our goal of providing the best possible avatar functionalities to our users.\n\n## References\n\n- [VRM 1.0 Specification](https://vrm.dev/en/vrm1/)", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "62138022-8a1c-4b48-9928-2520057f91fa": {"__data__": {"id_": "62138022-8a1c-4b48-9928-2520057f91fa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7e76bb44-83ad-4e9e-9f76-28339f551fb5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2c1c9ce093ee52c7ba1128786180de03b35a2c244dc74eb89a3aca22ea0f969a"}}, "hash": "c31b1058f750482685c5d948883ddb8623e606a8d45f2c0fa6415ce75469e0f5", "text": "# Aquarium Nightclub Booth for Virtual Market Exhibition\n\n## Metadata\n\n- Status: accepted <!-- draft | proposed | rejected | accepted | deprecated | superseded by -->\n- Deciders: V-Sekai, fire, ect, Aeris, cyberpunkmermaid,\n- Tags: V-Sekai, GPT-4, Virtual Reality, Cocoon Art Aquarium, VKET 2023 Summer, Voiceless, \n\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\nDesign a 4m x 4m x 5m Aquarium Nightclub themed booth.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nCreate an immersive environment combining aquarium and nightclub elements, including aquatic decorations, lighting, interactivity, a hostess, and ambient music.\n\n### Key Features\n\n1. **Aquatic-themed decorations**: Use 3D models of marine life, such as fish, corals, and seaweed, to create a colourful underwater environment.\n2.

The current implementation mimics mouse input, but it fails to translate global positions correctly. Review the `global_to_viewport` function and ensure it returns the correct value for `local_at`.\n\n## The Upside\n\nFixing the menus will enable players to interact with them using VR controllers, enhancing the user experience.\n\n## The Downside\n\nFixing the menus may require significant code changes, introducing potential bugs or conflicts that need proper testing to ensure stability.\n\n## The Road Not Taken\n\nExploring alternative input systems specifically designed for VR controllers could be considered, but it may involve rewriting a large portion of the menu code and potentially introducing new dependencies.\n\n## The Infrequent Use Case\n\nThis fix targets players using VR controllers to interact with the menus. Players without VR controllers will not be affected.\n\n## In Core and Done by Us?\n\nYes, this issue falls within our core development responsibilities, and we will take ownership of fixing the menus.\n\n## Further Reading\n\n- [V-Sekai](https://v-sekai.org/)\n- This article is assisted by AI.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5859595c-d3d3-45b1-ad1e-fbb3919e5ac0": {"__data__": {"id_": "5859595c-d3d3-45b1-ad1e-fbb3919e5ac0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "55f8a0a4-a6f8-42c3-a32e-8b70c5450c7d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d360a7c3652a7e0b1870d2020a550e4526b3cde0818c5d8b2c2e888b11eb3afc"}}, "hash": "71ad0881350c82cfdd51bf3ba8846d815a56acc7594e127dbe02aafdc1921938", "text": "# Complete glTF2 / VRM import and export pipeline in Godot Engine\n\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\nWe are unable to import characters in animations and unable to export them.\n\n## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nVRM and glTF import allows us to bring models in and export allows us to get the models out.\n\n## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams\n\nTo be determined.\n\n## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- Character import supports\n- World export support\n\n## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- Technical debt\n\n(this section can be repeated for each option, if more than one option is open for consideration\n\n## Option graveyard: USDZ\n\nList the proposed options no longer open for consideration.\n\nList the reasons for the rejection: (the Bad traits)\n\n- Requires GDNative\n- Complicated\n\n## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nPossible to be gdscript\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nWe need to provide trust for the toolchains.\n\n## References <!-- optional -->\n\n- [Notary Trust](20210523-complete-gltf2-vrm-import-and-export-pipeline-in-godot-engine.md)\n\n## Derivative License\n\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Consider articulating the case in the form of a question.\n\nCurrently, V-Sekai lacks a comprehensive VR design application that provides polygon mesh-based sculpting tools for users with varying levels of experience. How can we integrate such a tool to enhance the creative capabilities of our users?\n\n## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nIntegrate a powerful VR design application, such as Gravity Sketch, which offers a wide range of polygon mesh-based sculpting tools. This will cater to both beginners and experienced 3D artists, allowing them to create intricate designs within the V-Sekai environment.\n\n## Describe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\n\n1. Research available VR design applications that meet the requirements.\n2. Evaluate the compatibility of the chosen application with V-Sekai.\n3. Develop an integration plan, including necessary API calls and user interface adjustments.\n4. Implement the integration, ensuring seamless functionality within V-Sekai.\n5. Test the integrated application with various user profiles to ensure usability and performance.\n\n## Positive Consequences\n\n- Enhanced creative capabilities for V-Sekai users.\n- Attraction of a wider user base, including experienced 3D artists.\n- Improved user satisfaction and engagement.\n\n## Negative Consequences\n\n- Potential increase in system requirements for V-Sekai.\n- Additional development time and resources required for integration.\n\n## Option graveyard\n\n- Developing a custom VR design application from scratch (time-consuming and resource-intensive).\n\n## If this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nNo, as the enhancement involves integrating a complex VR design application that cannot be achieved through a simple script workaround.\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nYes, integrating a powerful VR design application will significantly enhance the creative capabilities of V-Sekai users, making it a core feature that directly impacts user experience and satisfaction.\n\n## References\n\n- [V-Sekai](https://v-sekai.org/)\n- Cassie on Github: https://github.com/V-Sekai/cassie\n- Shapelab by Leopoly on Steam\n- Gravity Sketch on Steam\n- Substance 3D Modeler 2023 on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1745780/Substance_3D_Modeler_2023/", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1818fd1d-056e-418f-8e96-79eccc6446fc": {"__data__": {"id_": "1818fd1d-056e-418f-8e96-79eccc6446fc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "38f6d1a9-ec12-4848-b8b6-0984267e36ba", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d31bb34a1c58f2be6c849eae276decaa98f8ac925c856a770a02a3cdcb01f90b"}}, "hash": "3b827172a5de1dd1861c51017b1eb06c1f91fdff5235092ca3841c0bb1f9d13b", "text": "# Lightweight quality avatars\n\n### Describe the status of the issue.\n\n- [x] proposed\n- [x] draft\n- [ ] rejected\n- [ ] accepted\n- [ ] deprecated\n- [ ] superseded by\n\n### List the deciders of the issue.\n\nV-Sekai,fire,Yin Chien YEAP,\n\n### Describe the tags of the issue.\n\nV-Sekai,avatars,\n\n### Context and Problem Statement\n\nYin works a lot in webxr, and noticed in the avatar ecosystem (VRchat, secondlife, etc.) most of these avatars are too high quality.\n\nWhat tools have we come across that have enabled lightweight avatars?\n\n### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nTo try to make things work for webxr, yin is interested in lightweight avatars in as many ways as possible.\nexploring avatars that are as parametric as possible.\n\n### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\n\nFind ways to define volumes as parametric, and textures based on vectors instead of bitmaps.\n\nFrame time: Using a mobile chip gives less headroom re: polys that can be dropped.

Currently probably the best way to learn Kaolin is to take a look through the documentation and look for relevant functions. We hope to make more demos which will make learning Kaolin smoother in the future.\n\nThe functions which will be useful to you would be:\n\n`kaolin.io.obj.import_mesh` to import a mesh.\n\n`torch.meshgrid` to generate a bunch of 3D coordinates of a voxel grid.\n\n`kaolin.metrics.trianglemesh.point_to_mesh_distance` to get the distance function for those points.\n\n`kaolin.ops.mesh.check_sign` to get the sign of the points to multiply with the distance.\n\n`kaolin.ops.conversions.voxelgrids_to_trianglemeshes` to convert the SDF grid to a mesh.\n\n## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- [e.g., improvement of quality attribute satisfaction, follow-up decisions required, \u2026]\n\n## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- Might require the GPU.\n- Inferencing may be difficult at interactive rates.\n\n## Option graveyard: <!-- same as above -->\n\n- Option: <!-- [List the proposed options no longer open for consideration.] -->\n- Rejection Reason: <!-- [List the reasons for the rejection: (the Bad traits)] -->\n\n## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nCUDA, PyTorch and c++ are significant works.\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nI have an approach!\n\n## References <!-- optional -->\n\n- https://kaolin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/installation.html\n- https://www.alecjacobson.com/weblog/?tag=qslim\n\n## Derivative License\n\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

It details an AI framework and production pipeline that allow designers to craft huge amount of AI archetypes quickly and flexibly. Next, Genshin's pathfinding service is introduced, an approach to reduce NavMesh disk and memory space overhead, caused by continuously-growing world map. Finally, this session discusses AI performance optimization and shows how AI system can be modularized and broke down into multi-threaded tasks on CPU.\n- Emotional Systemic Facial of 'Last of Us Part II'\n  As graphic fidelity in video games has rapidly accelerated, one aspect of development has overwhelmingly remained stagnant; in-game character emotions. In this talk, Naughty Dog explores how they addressed this industry wide limitation in The Last of Us Part II. Represented by team members from character rigging, animation, dialogue, and design; this talk comprehensively covers how character emotion was brought into gameplay ranging from nuanced narrative moments to adrenaline charged melee combat. Learn about the challenges, implementation, and innovation that occurred to develop the systemic emotion system that brought over 65 characters speaking 13 languages with up to 20 individual emotions to life.\n- Motion Matching in 'The Last of Us Part II'\n  Naughty Dog is known for the animation quality of their titles. For The Last of Us Part II, they decided to take a leap of faith and switch to at that time pretty experimental animation system called Motion Matching. Two Naughty Dog technical animators will tell you the story of initial joy, later frustration and ultimate fear as the development of the new project went on and but not everything went according to plan. Thanks to many clever solution, hard work and a very talented team, Naughty Dog was able to ship a game that was unanimously praised for animation quality among critics and players.\n- https://tabletomarkdown.com/convert-spreadsheet-to-markdown/\n- https://github.com/deflinhec/GodotGoogleSheet\n- https://baserow.io/\n- https://github.com/fenix-hub/godot-engine.easy-charts\n- https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/32408\n\n### Derivative License\n\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "88502926-e9e4-481a-a6c0-40ea7702cb3f": {"__data__": {"id_": "88502926-e9e4-481a-a6c0-40ea7702cb3f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ca54be2b-fcb7-4cd2-8393-fc6925a5c372", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c4cf8ce22c6958cb6c1df583083ad08ac3cde342c36775cce382e6e4ab6ebbf7"}, "2": {"node_id": "a719ad2e-e66d-4bda-bda3-311bb0cc97d3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "cbc79389e73941a2b49d4127597b645225d920df2abda4573495911bba3e8759"}}, "hash": "d96cddad1b79797a6e078ce8781c5b55cdd62d80d7feb628ad5881225f03774c", "text": "IN NO EVENT SHALL THE\nAUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER\nLIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM,\nOUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE\nSOFTWARE.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fd8d646a-61d4-4336-a784-a2fdf066317d": {"__data__": {"id_": "fd8d646a-61d4-4336-a784-a2fdf066317d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99ce81b4-5c48-42b7-96f2-6b08e283ad7a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "9be30b993ce6b98be45709d4df7d6691f732986c0033891a8d85efdef57338cc"}}, "hash": "c2c1257e89cecac8ff5a8c683287491aa02c95ce1d2eae05591f40e8400d7647", "text": "# Tools helpful for creating Avatars and Worlds\n\n- Status: proposed <!-- draft | proposed | rejected | accepted | deprecated | superseded by -->\n- Deciders: V-Sekai,fire,\n- Tags: V-Sekai,\n\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\nWant to list some useful tools for world and character creation and are free, open-source and remixable for commercial uses.\n\n## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nThere many tools out there that are helpful for world and character creation.\n\n## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\n\n1.

This has resulted in a halt in the development process, causing delays in project timelines.\n\n## The Challenge \n\nThe main challenge is to unmerge the broken tree and then successfully merge it again. This requires careful analysis of the code and understanding the root cause of the initial failed merge.\n\n## The Strategy \n\nWe use a tool called Git Assembly which makes reapplying branches on master easy. Here's the strategy:\n\n1. Identify the commit hash where the merge went wrong.\n3. Remove the item from the Git Assembler.\n4. Analyze the code and identify the conflicts that caused the merge to fail.\n5. Resolve the conflicts manually.\n6. Fix the branch.\n7. Reapply the branch on master using Git Assembly.\n\n## The Upside \n\nBy following this strategy, we can potentially fix the broken source code tree without losing any significant work. This will allow us to resume the development process and meet our project deadlines.\n\n## The Downside \n\nThe process of unmerging and merging can be time-consuming and complex. If not done correctly, it may lead to further issues in the codebase.\n\n## The Road Not Taken \n\nAn alternative approach could have been to abandon the current branch and start a new one from the last known good state. However, this would mean losing all the changes made after the last good state.\n\n## The Infrequent Use Case \n\nThis procedure is not commonly used as merges usually go smoothly. It's only needed when a merge results in a broken source code tree.\n\n## In Core and Done by Us?  \n\nYes, this procedure is core to our operations and is performed by our team.\n\n## Further Reading \n\n- [V-Sekai](https://v-sekai.org/) \n- This article is assisted by AI.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2022484d-bcd4-4729-be77-331dc9e89880": {"__data__": {"id_": "2022484d-bcd4-4729-be77-331dc9e89880", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "159f35da-0589-4418-8688-e3244bd49d40", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "fac438f6843313a5def4b5617d069d4228f65ab3f74eeb8a787dcde40292cd66"}}, "hash": "315828cbc31ae1cfe0ba42e1a1c91ed21623c37f68175051d1922ce0a3bb897e", "text": "## Describe a avatar publishing workflow for portability\n\n## Metadata\n\n- Status: draft <!-- draft | proposed | rejected | accepted | deprecated | superseded by -->\n- Deciders: V-Sekai, fire\n- Tags: V-Sekai, ChatGPT-4, Avatar Publishing, Workflow, Portability, VRM Format, Silent's Shader, Platform Compatibility, Sketchfab, Booth.pm\n\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\nWe want to create a workflow for publishing avatars in a portable format that can be easily used across different platforms. The goal is to streamline the process of converting and exporting avatars while maintaining compatibility with various platforms.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nThe proposed solution involves using the VRM portable avatar format, Silent's shader, and platform-specific package bundles to create a seamless workflow for avatar publishing.\n\n## Implementation\n\n1. Import avatar in VRM0 portable avatar format.\n2. Install Silent's shader 1.11.\n3. Convert VRM to compatible platform's internal format. \n  a. Avoid \"Combine Mesh\" option.\n  b. The Cutout Rendering Mode matches VRM's usual transparency usage.\n  c. UNRESOLVED: VRM Colliders cause greatly increased count of simulated physics objects\n     ii. Try switching to inside bounds instead of bone as spheres\n4. Swap the mtoon material for Silent's shader's crosstone material. Fire doesn't use the light-ramp shader.\n5. Many bones need to be the first child for IK to work.\n6. Fire prefers solid colour backgrounds for avatar photos\n7. Export as a compatible platform package bundle.\n8. Bundle VRM and compatible platform package bundle and publish on Sketchfab and/or Booth.pm.\n9. The compatible platform should display the avatar as **poor** rated.\n\n## Positive Consequences\n\n- Streamlined avatar publishing process.\n- Increased portability and compatibility with different platforms.\n- Easier sharing and distribution of avatars.\n\n## Negative Consequences\n\n- Potential loss of some features or quality during conversion.\n- May require additional work to ensure compatibility with all desired platforms.\n\n## Option graveyard\n\nN/A\n\n## If this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nNo, this enhancement aims to create a comprehensive workflow for avatar publishing, which cannot be achieved with just a few lines of script.\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nYes, creating a standardized workflow for avatar publishing ensures consistency and compatibility across platforms, making it easier for users to share and distribute their avatars.\n\n## References\n\n- V-Sekai: [V-Sekai](https://v-sekai.org/)\n- Silent Cel Shading Shader: [SCSS](https://gitlab.com/s-ilent/SCSS/-/tree/master/Assets/Silent's%20Cel%20Shading%20Shader)\n- Silent Cel Shading Shader v1.11: [Silent Cel Shading Shader v1.11](https://gitlab.com/s-ilent/SCSS/-/releases/v1.11)\n- Booth.pm: [Booth.pm](https://booth.pm/)\n- Sketchfab: [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/)\n- VRM converter for compatible platform: [VRM converter](https://booth.pm/en/items/1025226)\n  * Automatically installs Univrm: [Univrm](https://github.com/vrm-c/UniVRM)", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3ea7ff1f-11ed-466a-a328-8bc7f3289be4": {"__data__": {"id_": "3ea7ff1f-11ed-466a-a328-8bc7f3289be4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "534a3d4d-4b71-487d-b479-0dbd11b5b44c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7dacf4874be7b75a7df084a300f4527bf949eb1181a6d46fc9fbab98b4fe4619"}}, "hash": "7dacf4874be7b75a7df084a300f4527bf949eb1181a6d46fc9fbab98b4fe4619", "text": "# Solve a V-Sekai naming convention limitation.\n\n## Metadata\n\n- Status: proposed <!-- draft | proposed | rejected | accepted | deprecated | superseded by -->\n- Deciders: V-Sekai,fire,\n- Tags: V-Sekai,chatgpt4,naming conventions,standardization,code organization,documentation,project management,\n\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\nWe use different kinds of names for V-Sekai, such as `v-sekai`, `V-Sekai`, `vsk`, and `v_sekai`. It is confusing to find a scheme that fits the various naming conventions. Hyphens are banned in Godot Engine file systems, but allowed in GitHub branch names. We also use the `godot_addon` convention sometimes. How can we document and unify the naming conventions across different platforms and contexts?\n\n## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nCreate a standardized naming convention guideline that defines the preferred format for all instances of V-Sekai's name in code, documentation, and other materials, taking into account the specific requirements and limitations of each platform and context.\n\n## Describe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\n\n1. Define the preferred naming convention for V-Sekai in different contexts:\n   - Godot Engine file systems: `vsk_default`\n   - GitHub branch names: `v-sekai-wasm`\n   - Addon naming: `addons/vsk_avatar`\n   - Github repository names must all be lowercase:\n      - GitHub is case-insensitive: this can result in users or devs inadvertently typing the wrong case in one case\n      - Windows is case-insensitive, so the above mistake can go unnoticed until the addon is used on a different OS\n2.

The goal is to find a system that can offer scalability, ease of deployment, and efficient resource management.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nOne potential solution could be [Dokku](http://dokku.viewdocs.io/dokku/), a Docker-powered mini-Heroku. Dokku provides a platform that could potentially meet our needs for building, deploying and managing applications effectively.\n\n## Implementation\n\nIf Dokku were chosen, the implementation would involve setting up a Dokku server, migrating existing services, and training the team on how to use Dokku for development and deployment.\n\n```bash\n# Install Dokku\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dokku/dokku/v0.21.4/bootstrap.sh;\nsudo DOKKU_TAG=v0.21.4 bash bootstrap.sh\n```\n\n## Potential Benefits\n\n- **Scalability**: Dokku has features that could allow us to scale our applications based on demand.\n- **Ease of Deployment**: Dokku's git-based deployment system might simplify the process of deploying new versions of our applications.\n- **Resource Management**: Dokku's use of Docker containers could lead to more efficient use of system resources.\n\n## Potential Drawbacks\n\n- There might be a learning curve for the team members who are not familiar with Dokku or Docker.\n- Migration of existing services to a new platform could require significant time and resources.\n\n## Option Graveyard\n\nOther options considered include traditional VM-based hosting and other PaaS solutions like Heroku or AWS Elastic Beanstalk. These options have their own sets of advantages and disadvantages that need to be weighed against those of Dokku.\n\n## If this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nThis depends on the specific requirements of our backend services. If the enhancement is fundamental to the hosting and development of our backend services, it may not be possible to work around it with a few lines of script.\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nThe choice of hosting and development environment is crucial for the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations. Whether Dokku or another solution is chosen, it will be important for us to maintain control over this aspect of our infrastructure.\n\n## References\n\n- [V-Sekai](https://v-sekai.org/)\n- [Dokku Documentation](http://dokku.viewdocs.io/dokku/)", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fa3c1a65-6c38-4991-9f14-0ccf062a2cf4": {"__data__": {"id_": "fa3c1a65-6c38-4991-9f14-0ccf062a2cf4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6639f63b-4528-445b-b19a-bdfb74acf0de", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "97fa376b898ec569cf118768cd283ac3182710e52b03b951585f10a2456ec85c"}}, "hash": "7a56da05dad39f265f78537117a04cf93abf3e96a3afee33c4a69fab86fb24c2", "text": "# Have wires in 3d\n\n### Context and Problem Statement\n\nHave wires in 3d to simulate connections\n\n### Describe the feature / enhancement and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nVertlet Rope wires\n\n### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams\n\nVertlet Rope wires project\n\n### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nIs a few hundred lines of gdscript\n\n### Positive Consequences\n\n_No response_\n\n### Negative Consequences\n\n_No response_\n\n### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nporting is easy by me\n\n### References\n\n_No response_\n\n### Derivative License\n\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

This process eliminates the need for a face camera and leverages the `SpeechEncoderDecoderModel` from Hugging Face's Transformers library for comprehensive speech recognition.\n\nThe SpeakingFaces dataset, a collection from 142 diverse subjects, will be utilized for this project. The dataset is accessible via the server of the Institute for Smart Systems and Artificial Intelligence (ISSAI) under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.\n\nOutlines \u3030, a neural text generation library, will also play a crucial role in this project. It offers robust prompting primitives, separates the prompting from the execution logic, and is compatible with all models. It interfaces with models through the next-token logits and can be used with API-based models as well.\n\n## The Challenge\n\nThe primary challenge lies in developing a model capable of generating text and blendshapes simultaneously from the same input speech using the Outlines \u3030 library.\n\n## The Strategy\n\nThe proposed strategy involves creating a custom model that accepts speech as input and outputs both text and blendshapes. This unified model would incorporate a shared encoder to process the speech input, and a single decoder to generate the text and blendshape outputs. The Outlines \u3030 library will be used to conform the output to the desired format.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "423cf25a-5a6a-41c4-b687-9f1b439cd8f4": {"__data__": {"id_": "423cf25a-5a6a-41c4-b687-9f1b439cd8f4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3c7b2003-6929-402d-b731-c18004d9d708", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f0ce9b601aa814a212e1b85f962fb938b9c18cd2f62153fdd368df57253da5ac"}, "2": {"node_id": "73d5ee24-e663-42b0-90dc-bb9567d8bdb1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f1c3f7a5c7fccdcb6ba1fa0ab5619821eddc85bb7fd3f02086509709be23807c"}, "3": {"node_id": "c4b7e327-8c4a-4be8-97a8-788052f35b71", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7423105b548fdf0b26f91f3ab254420b3a549afa381814806606466203c636f3"}}, "hash": "ae532a736ab10f9ed11a7e0e40a2f54120dfc4e04adabeee1ff59f5972b77913", "text": "The Outlines \u3030 library will be used to conform the output to the desired format.\n\n```python\nfrom outlines import Outline\nfrom transformers import SpeechEncoderDecoderModel, Speech2Text2Processor, Wav2Vec2Model\nimport json\n\n# Initialize the processor and encoder\nprocessor = Speech2Text2Processor.from_pretrained(\"facebook/s2t-small-librispeech-asr\")\nencoder = Wav2Vec2Model.from_pretrained(\"facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h\")\n\n# Initialize the decoder\ndecoder = Speech2Text2Model.from_pretrained(\"facebook/s2t-small-librispeech-asr\")\n\n# Initialize the unified model\nmodel = UnifiedSpeechEncoderDecoderModel(encoder=encoder, decoder=decoder)\n\n# Define an outline for the model\noutline = Outline(model).to(device)\n\n# Generate text and blendshapes\ngenerated_text, generated_blendshapes = outline.generate(input_speech)\n\n# Conform to JSON schema\u00df\u00df\nblendshapes_keys = [\"BrowInnerUp\", \"BrowDownLeft\", \"BrowDownRight\", \"BrowOuterUpLeft\", \"BrowOuterUpRight\",\n                    \"EyeLookUpLeft\", \"EyeLookUpRight\", \"EyeLookDownLeft\", \"EyeLookDownRight\", \"EyeLookInLeft\",\n                    \"EyeLookInRight\", \"EyeLookOutLeft\", \"EyeLookOutRight\", \"EyeBlinkLeft\", \"EyeBlinkRight\",\n                    \"EyeSquintRight\", \"EyeSquintLeft\", \"EyeWideLeft\", \"EyeWideRight\", \"CheekPuff\",\n                    \"CheekSquintLeft\", \"CheekSquintRight\", \"NoseSneerLeft\", \"NoseSneerRight\", \"JawOpen\",\n                    \"JawForward\", \"JawLeft\", \"JawRight\", \"MouthFunnel\", \"MouthPucker\", \"MouthLeft\",\n                    \"MouthRight\", \"MouthRollUpper\", \"MouthRollLower\", \"MouthShrugUpper\", \"MouthShrugLower\",\n                    \"MouthClose\", \"MouthSmileLeft\", \"MouthSmileRight\", \"MouthFrownLeft\", \"MouthFrownRight\",\n                    \"MouthDimpleLeft\", \"MouthDimpleRight\", \"MouthUpperUpLeft\", \"MouthUpperUpRight\",\n                    \"MouthLowerDownLeft\", \"MouthLowerDownRight\", \"MouthPressLeft\", \"MouthPressRight\",\n                    \"MouthStretchLeft\", \"MouthStretchRight\", \"TongueOut\"]\n\noutput = {\n    \"text\": generated_text,\n    \"blendshapes\": dict(zip(blendshapes_keys, generated_blendshapes))\n}\n\njson_output = json.dumps(output)\n```\n\n## The Upside\n\nDeveloping our own unified model for generating both text and blendshapes from speech using the Outlines \u3030 library is a strategic move that provides us with greater control and customization to meet our specific needs.

Mid-term goals include working on the network, entity system, background loading, UI improvements, and developing a lightweight relay instance server. Finally, long-term goals involve scalable instances, network topology implementation, streamlined content creation, zero stutter loading, enhancing social and upload features, video and music playback and live streaming, scripting integrations, UX work for non-technical users, and in-editor content building UX.\n\nOne challenge the project faces is maintaining and improving the existing codebase, which includes outdated workarounds from Godot 3. Another setback was the change from OpenVR to OpenXR. Content is another hurdle: transferring a world from other platforms to V-Sekai is currently best accomplished by exporting source assets such as glTF or FBX. The project aims to cater to non-technical users, making it more accessible than other platforms. WASM-based scripting is being considered, but there are concerns about implementation challenges and security.\n\nIn addition, the V-Sekai project needs a project manager, and the team struggles to find collaborators who share their vision and can dedicate enough time to contribute significantly. Nevertheless, despite the long list of features needed for basic functionality, the team believes that V-Sekai is essential for the future of the Metaverse space, and that will draw collaborators to assist on our common vision.\n\nIt's important that our roadmap and goals continue to be discussed and iterated on. Nothing should be seen as final, since technology changes so rapidly and consensus is important.\n\n### Positive Consequences\n\nWe can create V-Sekai easier.\n\n### Negative Consequences\n\nOverhead might be hard.\n\n### Option graveyard\n\n- Relying on informal communication and ad-hoc collaboration\n- Continuing with the current approach without a structured process", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8b7f4e46-10cb-4b9a-88d0-432425b12c2d": {"__data__": {"id_": "8b7f4e46-10cb-4b9a-88d0-432425b12c2d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1057a33d-cae2-4e27-bfa6-314276ef2e63", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f21e57232d214a58be9d04f477c5fec6620c95ece5cb6e37f880e1cdb7c29c9e"}, "2": {"node_id": "b37163da-79b2-471f-867d-e25607f48986", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "33cc96ed02faff5dfd845ebb3f1227decade54f215a80e85893c8466c69e385b"}}, "hash": "503738c19c4d51002518ac019aa5a437a614f7082ab579bb8312b6de57fcad33", "text": "### If this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nNo. This is a process.\n\n### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nThis is a core process for V-Sekai.\n\n### References\n\n- [V-Sekai](https://v-sekai.org/)", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4589fcab-6179-4c33-bbf4-3c26bd99a56e": {"__data__": {"id_": "4589fcab-6179-4c33-bbf4-3c26bd99a56e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "070d831c-2555-41d8-98b0-043618c76f73", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6e4513945ed22bf782676705e912f7e8d2a1da2221c62901de2911d50ffc5649"}, "3": {"node_id": "8aed2bdb-2ee2-4ffd-aee3-aac3a64d9db6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "8d1a5cd4221cea43ed5ff98614e8cc8e450c71cd34fbecafeaa24a46814014e5"}}, "hash": "fec5c90dd6e198b515d757dfc1c7cca0cb3545644e0ff7eb130a3a0ed55f0f02", "text": "# How to start a development environment for cockroach and elixir?\n\n### Describe the status of the issue.\n\n- [x] proposed\n- [ ] draft\n- [ ] rejected\n- [x] accepted\n- [ ] deprecated\n- [ ] superseded by\n\n### List the deciders of the issue.\n\nV-Sekai,lyuma,fire,\n\n### Describe the tags of the issue.\n\nV-Sekai,\n\n### Context and Problem Statement\n\nHow do we start our uro backend?\n\nSee also [20230107-elixir-uro-dev-sqlite](20230107-elixir-uro-dev-sqlite.md).\n\n### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nWrite documentation how to update elixir.\n\n### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\n\nDownload the cockroach distribution and run this:\n\n```bash\n./cockroach.exe start-single-node  --insecure --store=node1 --listen-addr=localhost:26257 --http-addr=localhost:8080\n```\n\nYou can add `--background` to run in the background.\n\nNext, compile uro.

It is the default package manager of [NetBSD](https://www.netbsd.org/) and [SmartOS](https://wiki.smartos.org/) and can be used to enable freely available software to be built quickly on a large number of other UNIX-like platforms.\n\n> V-Sekai is developing a free, open-source virtual reality platform. We work to make it user-friendly and fulfill a need in the VR community.\n\n### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\n1. Effortless installation and updates: Packaging Godot Engine for pkgin makes it easier to install and update the software on macOS, Linux, and NetBSD, offering a smooth experience for users at all expertise levels.\n2. Wider platform support: By embracing pkgsrc and packaging Godot Engine for pkgin, compatibility with an array of UNIX-like systems is ensured, broadening the user base and fostering adoption across different platforms.\n4. Promoting cooperation: V-Sekai's support for pkgsrc and packaging of the Godot Engine for pkgin enables collaboration through the vast third-party software ecosystem available for UNIX-like systems, stimulating the exchange of ideas and resources.\n5. Reinforcing open-source ideals: V-Sekai's decision to package the Godot Engine for pkgin strengthens its commitment to open-source values like accessibility, transparency, and community-driven development, enhancing growth within the VR community.\n\n### Describe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\n\n ```mermaid\ngraph LR\nA[Godot Engine Source Code] --> B[Build and Package]\nB --> C[Godot Engine pkgin Package]\nC --> D{Platform Compatibility}\nD --> E[macOS]\nD --> F[Linux]\nD --> G[NetBSD]\nC --> H[Package Repository]\nI[User] --> J[pkgin command]\nJ --> H\nH --> K[Install/Update Godot Engine]\nK --> I\n```\n\n### Positive Consequences\n\n1. Easy installation and updates: Pkgin support simplifies installing and updating the Godot Engine on UNIX-like systems, such as macOS, Linux, and NetBSD, providing a hassle-free experience for users.\n\n2. Wide platform support: Pkgin compatibility ensures that the Godot Engine works seamlessly with multiple UNIX-like systems, expanding the user base and promoting adoption across various platforms.\n\n3. Efficient dependency handling: Pkgin automatically manages dependencies, streamlining the installation process and minimizing conflicts or issues due to unmet requirements.\n\n4. Uniform software environment: Pkgin helps maintain consistency in software versions and configurations, which is crucial for collaboration and reducing the need for troubleshooting.\n\n5. Connection to the pkgsrc ecosystem: Supporting pkgin allows users to tap into the extensive third-party software ecosystem for UNIX-like systems, fostering the exchange of ideas and resources within the open-source community.\n\n6. Resource and time savings: By offering pkgin support, developers can concentrate on enhancing the Godot Engine and V-Sekai's VR platform features rather than manually managing software installations and updates.\n\n7. Emphasizing open-source principles: By endorsing pkgin, both V-Sekai and the Godot Engine reaffirm their commitment to open-source values, such as accessibility, transparency, and community-driven development, fostering growth and collaboration within the VR community.\n\n### Negative Consequences\n\nThere are some potential downsides to packaging the Godot Engine for pkgin, which include:\n\nAdditional maintenance work: Supporting pkgin may necessitate regular package updates to ensure compatibility with different systems and to keep up with new Godot Engine versions and features. This could require extra time and resources from the development team.\n\nIncomplete platform support: Pkgin is designed for UNIX-like systems, but it doesn't directly cater to users on other platforms, such as Windows.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "44a547cd-9da8-4a65-a39c-cf9d0d935560": {"__data__": {"id_": "44a547cd-9da8-4a65-a39c-cf9d0d935560", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bf37a705-4437-4f19-b148-e11b5adb231c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "11cdae05fc1d0b30d30eaa231a43e1ff4836d5c4935a5987bbe1219c7be79af5"}, "2": {"node_id": "b02ca602-763e-491a-8efb-6eb1b95ed97b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c94ccaca5f756820e4445a8d87021bdc366de2552f8217473e7b81076cb34b4e"}}, "hash": "5e2059a971cb0d044f5a9634a8dce5251437a31ecf4c1f9d44fee7dd8846fb2a", "text": "Supporting alternative package managers for non-UNIX platforms may demand extra efforts.\n\nUser learning curve: Users unfamiliar with pkgin or pkgsrc might need to invest time in learning to use the package manager effectively, which could pose a barrier for some users, particularly those new to UNIX-like systems or with limited package management experience.\n\nPotential compatibility challenges: While pkgin aims to provide compatibility across various UNIX-like systems, certain configurations or system setups may still pose difficulties. Addressing these issues might require more development and troubleshooting efforts.\n\nUnnecessary overhead for small projects: For smaller projects or users with minimal requirements, the added features and capabilities provided by pkgin support might be excessive. In such cases, the effort needed to maintain and use a pkgin package could outweigh its benefits.\n\nDespite these potential downsides, offering pkgin support can bring significant advantages, such as streamlining installation and updates, ensuring compatibility with UNIX-like systems, and promoting collaboration within the open-source community.\n\n### Option graveyard\n\nAlternative package managers: While other package managers like apt or yum might have been considered, they may need to provide different compatibility with BSD-type systems than pkgsrc. Pkgin, designed for pkgsrc, is the default package manager for systems like NetBSD and SmartOS, making it the ideal choice.\n\nManual installation: Requiring users to compile and install Godot Engine manually would complicate the process and be less user-friendly, particularly for novices. This approach could also result in software version inconsistencies and configuration issues, affecting user experience.\n\nCustom package manager: Developing a custom package manager specifically for V-Sekai's platform is resource-intensive and duplicates existing package managers' efforts, such as pkgin, which already offers compatibility with BSD-type systems.\n\nExclusively focusing on other platforms: By targeting only Linux, macOS, or Windows, V-Sekai would limit its potential user base and overlook the advantages of supporting UNIX-like systems like NetBSD and SmartOS. So instead, packaging Godot Engine for pkgin enables V-Sekai to reach a wider audience using BSD-type operating systems.\n\n### If this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nUsing a script for Godot Engine may have drawbacks, such as being less user-friendly, requiring more maintenance, having limited compatibility with BSD-type systems, and potentially impacting integration with the pkgsrc ecosystem.\n\n### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nPackaging the Godot Engine for pkgin as a core task our team handles ensures quality control, streamlined support, customization, alignment with your platform's vision, and trust-building with users. These factors contribute to the overall success and adoption of your open-source virtual reality platform.\n\n### References\n\n- [V-Sekai](https://v-sekai.org/)\n- https://pkgsrc.joyent.com/", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9ee95356-5539-479b-877b-b7c9785c5e3c": {"__data__": {"id_": "9ee95356-5539-479b-877b-b7c9785c5e3c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4bfd7da0-4ca0-4936-9755-3370936f896c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b714979e9475da51c2a32556e9f43c36bffb1c4c0956e4162f28d51340a23cb7"}}, "hash": "4bad093b658258e8efd8c8dabc1b6ae6905b7a9999011a7d77b6d00644a58bc6", "text": "#  Publish Godot VRM for Godot 4 for production use\n\n- Status: proposed <!-- draft | proposed | rejected | accepted | deprecated | superseded by -->\n- Deciders: V-Sekai,\n- Tags: V-Sekai,\n\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\nI want to be able to download the godot vrm addon from the asset library in 4.\n\n## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nBy publishing we will have reviewed the bugs and decide it is ready to be use.\n\n## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\n\nSubmit godot vrm to the godot 4 asset library lyuma \n\nStarted because of discussion with https://twitter.com/AlfredBaudisch/status/1586999148171198465?s=20&t=nUHLXskgrxnTbPFN9WzZxQ about mtoon outlines\n\n## Positive Consequences <!-- improvement of quality attribute satisfaction, follow-up decisions required -->\n\nWe'll prepare for release.\n\n## Negative Consequences <!-- compromising quality attribute, follow-up decisions required -->\n\nOld bugs might not be fixed.\n\n## Option graveyard:\n\n- Option: The status quo. <!-- List the proposed options no longer open for consideration. -->\n- Rejection Reason: This solves nothing. <!-- List the reasons for the rejection: (the bad traits) -->\n\n## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nGodot VRM is a few gdscripts.\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nGodot VRM is a core feature.\n\n## References\n\n- [V-Sekai](https://v-sekai.org/)\n\n## License of the contribution\n\n```\nMIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2018-present SaracenOne\nCopyright (c) 2019-present K.

To address these issues, we propose a new approach that leverages Elixir and the Membrane Framework. This will involve rewriting the code and introducing a JSON-RPC Blender runner.\n\n### Character Posing\n\nIn this new approach, character posing will be handled in real-time and shared across multiple clients. This means that any changes made to a 3D model by one user will be immediately reflected on all other connected clients. This feature will enhance the collaborative experience and allow users to interact with the same 3D models simultaneously.\n\n### World Sharing\n\nThe state of the world, including objects, lighting, camera position, etc., will also be synchronized across all clients. This ensures that all users are experiencing the same environment, further enhancing the sense of immersion and collaboration.\n\n### Procedural Generation\n\nWe will introduce procedural generation techniques to create unique and dynamic environments. These generated worlds will be shared across all clients, ensuring that each user's experience is not only immersive but also unique and engaging.\n\n### Grease Pencil Sharing\n\nAny drawings or annotations made using the Grease Pencil tool will be visible to all clients. This allows for collaborative sketching and planning, making it easier for teams to communicate their ideas visually.\n\n### JSON-RPC Blender Runner\n\nTo facilitate efficient communication with Blender, we'll implement a JSON-RPC Blender runner. This will allow us to send commands to Blender and receive responses in a structured and standardized format. This feature will streamline the process of interacting with Blender, making it more efficient and user-friendly.\n\nBy implementing these features, we aim to improve the scalability and real-time performance of our multiplayer Blender solution. This will lead to a more immersive and collaborative experience for our users.\n\n## The Challenge  \n\nThe main challenge is to translate the existing code into Elixir while maintaining the functionality and improving upon the limitations of the current system. This includes ensuring that the new code can handle larger volumes of users and provide real-time updates without lag or delay.\n\n## Strategy  \n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  A[Current Code] --> B[Elixir & Membrane Framework Code]\n  C[No Authentication] --> D[GitHub OAuth 2.0 Login]\n  E[No Database] --> F[Khepri Database Library]\n  G[Blender Runner] --> H[JSON-RPC Blender Runner]\n  I[Triangle Only] --> J[Airlocks for Environment Translation]\n```\n\nThis strategy leverages Elixir and the Membrane Framework's unique features, uses the Khepri database library for data management, implements GitHub login using OAuth 2.0 protocol for single sign-on, introduces a JSON-RPC Blender runner for improved communication with Blender, and focuses on the use of triangles (a polygon with 3 vertices) and \"Airlocks\" for environment translation.\n\nHere are the key steps:\n\n- **Codebase**: Transition from the current code to Elixir & Membrane Framework Code, tracked in a version control system.\n  \n- **Dependencies**: Declare and isolate dependencies explicitly, avoiding reliance on system-wide packages.\n\n- **Config**: Store configuration (including GitHub OAuth 2.0 Login credentials) in the environment, not in the code.\n\n- **Backing Services**: Replace in-memory data persistence with Khepri Database Library, attached as a backing service.\n\n- **Build, Release, Run**: Strictly separate these stages, facilitated by the Elixir & Membrane Framework Code.\n\n- **Processes**: Execute application as one or more stateless processes, storing needed state in the Khepri database.\n\n- **Port Binding**: Export services via port binding, making the application self-contained.\n\n- **Concurrency**: Scale out the application via the process model, allowing for handling increased load.\n\n- **Disposability**: Aim for fast startup and graceful shutdown to maximize robustness.\n\n- **Dev/Prod Parity**: Keep development, staging, and production environments as similar as possible.\n\n- **Logs**: Treat logs as event streams, handled by the executing environment.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c7cf2a38-ef49-4f5a-bc6b-64aa21777b6f": {"__data__": {"id_": "c7cf2a38-ef49-4f5a-bc6b-64aa21777b6f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "714d63a0-4b5e-4f3b-9091-69e87382cc01", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d714b123a2d318f81e74753a3759a9f27e1082d013fa6027d262bef886f47f45"}, "2": {"node_id": "301ab3c6-9be2-4965-ab45-f4dc8a5897f7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "49e5d7b1661f6fa0a0093793d2fea9b7e264a8fce34f8a6db3e705b1d272a327"}}, "hash": "3cb5b8c9c3963ae57057cb94ca82050e2233a1cb3785be86f9fd7b57a7113e54", "text": "- **Logs**: Treat logs as event streams, handled by the executing environment.\n\n- **Admin Processes**: Run any needed one-off administrative tasks in an identical environment as the regular long-running processes of the app.\n\n- **Blender Runner**: Implement a JSON-RPC Blender runner to facilitate efficient communication with Blender.\n\n- **Triangle Only**: This principle ensures that only triangles (polygons with 3 vertices) are used in the graphical representation. This simplifies the rendering process and reduces computational complexity.\n\n- **Airlocks**: Use airlocks to translate the remote environment to the local environment. This allows for seamless interaction between different parts of the system while maintaining isolation and security.\n\n## The Upside  \n\nBy rewriting the code in Elixir, using the Membrane Framework, implementing the Khepri database library, introducing a JSON-RPC Blender runner, focusing on the use of triangles, and employing the \"Airlocks\" principles, we can expect improved scalability and real-time performance. This will allow for more users to use the system simultaneously without experiencing delays or lags. Additionally, the fault-tolerance feature of Elixir will ensure that the system remains operational even when errors occur.\n\n## The Downside  \n\nRewriting the code will require time and resources. There may also be a learning curve for developers who are not familiar with Elixir, the Membrane Framework, the Khepri database library, JSON-RPC, the concept of using triangles in graphics, and \"Airlocks\".\n\n## The Road Not Taken  \n\nAn alternative approach would have been to optimize the existing code instead of rewriting it. However, this would not have addressed the inherent limitations of the current system.\n\n## The Infrequent Use Case  \n\nIn cases where the number of users is low and real-time updates are not critical, the current system may still be sufficient. However, as the user base grows and the demand for real-time updates increases, the need for a more scalable and efficient system becomes apparent.\n\n## In Core and Done by Us?  \n\nYes, the rewriting of the code will indeed be done by us as we also maintain the backend services.\n\n## Further Reading  \n\n- [V-Sekai](https://v-sekai.org/)  \n- [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/)\n- [Membrane Framework](https://www.membraneframework.org/)\n- [Khepri Database Library](https://hex.pm/packages/khepri)\n- [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/)\n\n*This article is assisted by AI.*", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a5642fa8-0a83-40cd-bec1-071534760b2e": {"__data__": {"id_": "a5642fa8-0a83-40cd-bec1-071534760b2e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "02c9ab33-29b9-4860-ae91-2fcf59f85aeb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "345ecc2e1605aec05cb63788caffa5e4c61b982b18fce629b99a2629c4d7c291"}, "3": {"node_id": "2055fa18-fcc4-45c7-ada8-16dbd5de267c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7e258a6c0ab1e8a5e3124f3f933498f4b8084862e182cbe2178344fb44a3529d"}}, "hash": "9a5221329f40c3f91c6d37e5f11b5992d4b2a2a35220e4f4870c852bf83ede26", "text": "# Extract proposals into proposals\n\n### Context and Problem Statement\n\nDecision trees are hard to use\n\n### Describe the feature / enhancement and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nConvert items in a decision tree into proposals\n\n### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams\n\n| Name                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                    | Task Stage       |\n| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |\n| GLTF #materialx                       |                                                                                                                                                                | idea             |\n| Godot CASSIE                          |                                                                                                                                                                | idea             |\n| Elixir membrane gltf processor        |                                                                                                                                                                | idea             |\n| Godot Dem Bones                       | Convert blend shapes to skeletal animation", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2055fa18-fcc4-45c7-ada8-16dbd5de267c": {"__data__": {"id_": "2055fa18-fcc4-45c7-ada8-16dbd5de267c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "02c9ab33-29b9-4860-ae91-2fcf59f85aeb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "345ecc2e1605aec05cb63788caffa5e4c61b982b18fce629b99a2629c4d7c291"}, "2": {"node_id": "a5642fa8-0a83-40cd-bec1-071534760b2e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "9a5221329f40c3f91c6d37e5f11b5992d4b2a2a35220e4f4870c852bf83ede26"}, "3": {"node_id": "0765fc39-4026-4361-bfa5-3915309cba46", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "838d8916834de01f3c16f4d8259e59fd766f6c5044a1810cee5f001125c409b9"}}, "hash": "7e258a6c0ab1e8a5e3124f3f933498f4b8084862e182cbe2178344fb44a3529d", "text": "| idea             |\n| robust-voip                           | voip or audio problems?

If the skeleton matches one of them, we can use that set of rig animations.\n\n## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nWe bake the RESET #animation and then set it to identity so that rigs with corresponding RESET #animation can have their #animation transferred.\n\n## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\n\n#### Bake RESET #animation\n\n1. Import a new scene with animations.\n1. A RESET #animation from the imported scene will automatically be baked to the skeleton.\n1. Key all RESET #animation frames to identity.\n\n#### Bake a specific frame\n\n1. Pick an #animation frame time and click\n2. First bake any existing RESET animation.\n3. Bake the RESET #animation\n4. Ensure that a RESET #animation track exists and is set to identity transform\n\n#### RESET #animation Generators\n\n1. Make a tool that can take a human character and make it T-pose (A-pose?) and then save it to the RESET animation.\n1. Enforce bone rolls on the rig and then save it to the RESET animation.\n1. Root motion centering (move to the origin) tool and then save it as the RESET animation.\n1. Filter the RESET axes when baking per animation.\n\n## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nThis is a confusing problem and hard to explain.

Showcase DOI Badge in Github README (optional)\n\n## Positive Consequences\n\n- Persistent DOIs for data and code\n- Effortless referencing of repositories across browsers\n- Enhanced visibility and accessibility of V-Sekai's digital artifacts\n\n## Negative Consequences\n\n- Necessitates managing multiple platforms (Github and Zenodo)\n- Possible learning curve for users unfamiliar with Github and Zenodo\n\n## Alternative Options\n\n1. **Utilizing Figshare**: Figshare is an alternative platform that enables assigning DOIs to digital artifacts. However, its integration with Github may not be as smooth as Zenodo's.\n\n2. **Manual DOI registration**: Manually registering a DOI through agencies like DataCite or CrossRef. This option can be labor-intensive and might involve additional fees.\n\n3. **Depending on publisher-assigned DOIs**: Some publishers allocate DOIs to supplementary materials during article publication. However, this option relies on the publisher's policies and may not encompass all digital artifacts.\n\n4. **Employing institutional repositories**: Certain institutions provide their own repositories for hosting digital artifacts and assigning DOIs. This option could be constrained by institutional policies and access limitations.\n\n5. **No DOI**: Opting not to assign a DOI to V-Sekai's digital artifacts, which would complicate referencing and long-term accessibility.\n\n## Can this enhancement be worked around with a few lines of script if used infrequently?\n\nNo, this solution demands integration between Github and Zenodo to produce a permanent DOI.\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and implemented by us?\n\nYes, allocating a permanent DOI to V-Sekai's digital artifacts guarantees long-term accessibility and accurate referencing in publications or other materials.\n\n## References\n\n- [V-Sekai](https://v-sekai.org/)\n- [Github](https://github.com/)\n- [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)\n- https://github.com/GlobalEcologyFlinders/assignDOI", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "038a5343-69d6-45cb-91ee-f86adda29226": {"__data__": {"id_": "038a5343-69d6-45cb-91ee-f86adda29226", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6e57c5a7-aab4-4040-a0b9-b56145398ecf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "12917c52d61de49fb6be911c50718a9b405efb52889115e25ac427c544b01a00"}}, "hash": "698b981de79c06b005a8ec093a619a6357c6411394a4bd58ae58f6f6af80a05b", "text": "# Cover 80% to 95% of the player base.\n\n### Metadata\n\n- Status: proposed <!-- draft | proposed | rejected | accepted | deprecated | superseded by -->\n- Deciders: V-Sekai,\n- Tags: V-Sekai,\n\n\n### Context and Problem Statement\n\nPeople want to use V-Sekai, we need to provide coverage of their electronic equipment.\n\n### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nCover 80% to 95% percent of the userbase's equipment, so people can play V-Sekai.\n\n### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\n\nProvide coverage of:\n\n1.

We are currently facing the challenge of how to handle authority transfer and state updates between simulation servers without incurring high network hop counts and latency.\n\nSomeone invited me to a popular VR platform and gave me a 20-minute tour, just enough to learn how to in desktop mode create a world, import an object, and inspector-edit it. So I imported our celebration map, and the map loaded in 20 seconds. I was able to change its transform. I'm still thinking about that experience.\n\n### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nWe propose to use a metadata system with Khepri instances and Raft consensus algorithm to manage ownership and mastership information for game entity nodes. Homeservers will manage metadata using their own Khepri instances within a Raft cluster, while simulation servers, including player simulation servers, will maintain game entity nodes they have authority over using their own Khepri instances.\n\nAuthority transfer will be initiated through the metadata Raft cluster when players interact with game entities governed by different simulation servers. The homeserver Khepri's nested path-to-value structure will be updated based on the ownership and mastership rules set by the Master. State updates will be exchanged between old and new authority simulation servers or synchronized using a separate mechanism during authority transfer.\n\nBy monitoring the load on homeservers and simulation servers, we can balance the system and ensure fault tolerance using Raft's mechanisms. As the number of game entity nodes and players grows, adding more homeservers to the metadata Raft cluster and more simulation servers will ensure efficient workload distribution and enhance the overall gaming experience.\n\nWe believe that this approach will provide strong consistency guarantees, access control, and scalability while minimizing network hop counts and latency for authority transfer and state updates between simulation servers.\n\n### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\n\n#### Glossary of terms\n\n1. **Homeserver**: A server responsible for managing metadata, including ownership and mastership information for game entity nodes.\n2. **Simulation server**: A server responsible for containing game entity nodes it has

Homeservers are responsible for managing metadata, including ownership and mastership information for game entity nodes, using a Khepri instance within a Raft cluster. Simulation servers, including player simulation servers, maintain game entity nodes they have authority over using their own Khepri instances.\n\nAuthority transfer is initiated through the metadata Raft cluster when players interact with game entities governed by different simulation servers. The homeserver Khepri's nested path-to-value structure is updated based on the ownership and mastership rules set by the Master. State updates are exchanged between old and new authority simulation servers or synchronized using a separate mechanism during authority transfer.\n\nMonitoring the load on homeservers and simulation servers allows for balancing the system and ensuring fault tolerance using Raft's mechanisms. As the number of game entity nodes and players grows, adding more homeservers to the metadata Raft cluster and more simulation servers ensures efficient workload distribution and enhances the overall gaming experience.\n\n## Distributed simulation architecture\n\nCase 1: Authority transfer from Player A to Player B on a different home server\n\n| Step | Description                                                                                   | Hop Count |\n| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |\n| 1    | Player A's simulation server sends a request to its homeserver (1 hop).                       | 1         |\n| 2    | Player A's homeserver sends an authority request to Player B's homeserver (H hops).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "26dffc1d-2112-4b95-bc8b-c62aaf0f862d": {"__data__": {"id_": "26dffc1d-2112-4b95-bc8b-c62aaf0f862d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "864f1a0b-2a49-4800-8ef7-fa2e23bfcce6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d31b246b506ed5fa6a71a2f15ccdb1035124a57eaac78c96a3c6fa146c77ce71"}, "2": {"node_id": "3ab94009-1fdb-49be-9508-d661b1e24db7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "deeb2c949f4b3e31dd96c28a9e4e22e6e4831075dde8557e41d0c2cd743b80ec"}, "3": {"node_id": "ac0a9622-eecf-4b3d-a8c8-ca2494ffaee5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f09559f26fd031bc92743133b00ed8d8a7e06a124468ed4ebbc322b7ccbce9b1"}}, "hash": "cae758ce71d854a7777fafad38c2ffbad452ff685e2afe6493c2543a0687e649", "text": "| H         |\n| 3    | Player B's homeserver sends a response to Player A's homeserver (H hops).                     | H         |\n| 4    | Player A's homeserver sends an authority response to Player A's simulation server (1 hop).    | 1         |\n| 5    | Player A's simulation server sends an acknowledgment to Player B's simulation server (1 hop). | 1         |\n\nSending an acknowledgment from Player A's homeserver to Player A's simulation server may not be necessary, as the authority request can be sent directly to Player B's homeserver without waiting for confirmation.\n\nTotal hops: 3 + 2 \\* H\n\nCase 2: Authority transfer if Player A's and Player B's homeservers are exactly the same\n\n| Step | Description                                                                                   | Hop Count |\n| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |\n| 1    | Player A's simulation server sends a request to its homeserver (1 hop).                       | 1         |\n| 2    | Player A's homeserver sends a response directly to Player B's simulation server (1 hop).      | 1         |\n| 3    | Player B's simulation server sends an acknowledgment to Player A's simulation server (1 hop). | 1         |\n\nTotal hops: 3\n\nIn this optimized process, we have removed sending an acknowledgment from Player A's homeserver to Player A's simulation server. This acknowledgment may not be necessary, as the response can be sent directly to Player B's simulation server without waiting for confirmation.

This could impact the overall performance of the distributed simulation system.\n\n3. **Scalability**: While the proposal aims to provide scalability, it is not clear how well the system will scale as the number of game entity nodes and players grows. Adding more homeservers and simulation servers might help, but there could still be bottlenecks or limitations that need to be addressed.\n\n4. **Security**: The proposed state transfer protocol relies on public key cryptography for secure communication between simulation servers. However, the security of the system depends on proper key management and protection against potential attacks, such as man-in-the-middle attacks or replay attacks.\n\n5. **Fault tolerance**: Although the Raft consensus algorithm provides fault tolerance, the system's resilience to failures (e.g., server crashes, network issues) needs to be carefully considered and tested to ensure smooth operation under various conditions.\n\n6. **Synchronization**: The proposal mentions that state updates are exchanged between old and new authority simulation servers or synchronized using a separate mechanism during authority transfer. However, it does not provide details on how this synchronization process works, which could be a critical aspect of the system's functionality.\n\n7. **Load balancing**: Monitoring the load on homeservers and simulation servers is essential for balancing the system. However, the proposal does not provide specific details on how load balancing will be achieved or what metrics will be used to determine when to add or remove servers from the system.\n\n### Option graveyard\n\nWe considered using a client-server model for the distributed simulation system but found that it would not provide the strong consistency guarantees and access control we require, and it would also be more difficult to scale as the number of game entity nodes and players grows.\n\n### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nThis is not a few lines of script.\n\n### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nI am exploring alternatives for the current implementation of the client-server

The main challenge faced by the V-Sekai project is to compete with established platforms like Roblox, which has a massive user base and a market valuation of $41 billion. The problem lies in finding ways to attract users, developers, and creators while maintaining a sustainable economic model.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nTo address the limitations of V-Sekai and make it competitive with platforms like Roblox, the following solutions are proposed:\n\n1. Implement a V-Sekai currency system: Convert fiat currency into in-game currency.\n2. Charge a fee for adding money into the system: This will help generate revenue for the platform and maintain its sustainability.\n3. Creators are paid directly for their content from V-Sekai.\n4. Prevent abuse and ensure fair distribution of resources.\n\n## Implementation\n\n1. Integrate a payment gateway to charge fees for adding money into the system.\n2. Implement usage limits for players and creators to ensure fair resource allocation.\n3. Offer creators a reward for their work.\n\n## Positive Consequences\n\n- Attracting more creators and users to the platform\n- Generating revenue to sustain the platform's growth\n- Ensuring fair distribution of resources among users and creators\n- Encouraging creators to have a fair share in the platform.\n\n## Negative Consequences\n\n- Potential backlash from users due to fees and usage limits\n- Legal complexities in treating creators fairly.\n- Balancing the currency system to prevent inflation or deflation\n\n## Option graveyard\n\nImplementing a single currency system: This option was discarded due to the potential for abuse and difficulty in balancing the economy.\n\n## If this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nNo, the proposed solution requires significant changes to the platform's core architecture and cannot be achieved through simple scripting.\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nYes, the proposed solution addresses fundamental limitations of the V-Sekai project and is essential for its success. It requires deep integration with the platform's core systems and should be implemented by the core development team.\n\n## References\n\n- [V-Sekai](https://v-sekai.org/)", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ce99da1b-1827-43b5-8697-c30e4331ccb6": {"__data__": {"id_": "ce99da1b-1827-43b5-8697-c30e4331ccb6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e4f4accb-2652-430e-8a8b-407c5b9e0c99", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bade5542a94dcbb1aaacbce47e2079da301d5901913038031a27858cfacad470"}}, "hash": "bade5542a94dcbb1aaacbce47e2079da301d5901913038031a27858cfacad470", "text": "# Rewriting Mixer Broadcaster Into Membrane Framework Pipelines\n\n## Metadata  \n\n- **Status**: Rejected\n- **Deciders**: V-Sekai  \n- **Tags**: V-Sekai, Elixir, Membrane Framework, Multiplayer Blender\n\n## The Backdrop  \n\nUbisoft's mixer broadcaster code has been the only available solution for handling multiplayer Blender. However, it has its limitations when it comes to scalability and real-time performance. This proposal aims to rewrite the code using Elixir and the Membrane Framework.\n\n## The Challenge  \n\nThe main challenge is to translate the existing code into Elixir while maintaining the functionality and improving upon the limitations of the current system. This includes ensuring that the new code can handle larger volumes of users and provide real-time updates without lag or delay.\n\n## Strategy  \n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  A[Ubisoft's Mixer Broadcaster Code] --> B[Elixir & Membrane Framework Code]\n  C[No Authentication] --> D[GitHub OAuth 2.0 Login]\n  E[No Database] --> F[Khepri Database Library]\n```\n\nThis strategy leverages Elixir and the Membrane Framework's unique features, uses the Khepri database library for data management, and implements GitHub login using OAuth 2.0 protocol for single sign-on.\n\nHere are the key steps:\n\n- **Codebase**: Transition from Ubisoft's Mixer Broadcaster Code to Elixir & Membrane Framework Code, tracked in a version control system.\n  \n- **Dependencies**: Declare and isolate dependencies explicitly, avoiding reliance on system-wide packages.\n\n- **Config**: Store configuration (including GitHub OAuth 2.0 Login credentials) in the environment, not in the code.\n\n- **Backing Services**: Replace in-memory data persistence with Khepri Database Library, attached as a backing service.\n\n- **Build, Release, Run**: Strictly separate these stages, facilitated by the Elixir & Membrane Framework Code.\n\n- **Processes**: Execute application as one or more stateless processes, storing needed state in the Khepri database.\n\n- **Port Binding**: Export services via port binding, making the application self-contained.\n\n- **Concurrency**: Scale out the application via the process model, allowing for handling increased load.\n\n- **Disposability**: Aim for fast startup and graceful shutdown to maximize robustness.\n\n- **Dev/Prod Parity**: Keep development, staging, and production environments as similar as possible.\n\n- **Logs**: Treat logs as event streams, handled by the executing environment.\n\n- **Admin Processes**: Run any needed one-off administrative tasks in an identical environment as the regular long-running processes of the app.\n\n## The Upside  \n\nBy rewriting the code in Elixir, using the Membrane Framework, and implementing the Khepri database library, we can expect improved scalability and real-time performance. This will allow for more users to use the system simultaneously without experiencing delays or lags. Additionally, the fault-tolerance feature of Elixir will ensure that the system remains operational even when errors occur.\n\n## The Downside  \n\nRewriting the code will require time and resources. There may also be a learning curve for developers who are not familiar with Elixir, the Membrane Framework, and the Khepri database library.\n\n## The Road Not Taken  \n\nAn alternative approach would have been to optimize the existing code instead of rewriting it. However, this would not have addressed the inherent limitations of the current system.\n\n## The Infrequent Use Case  \n\nIn cases where the number of users is low and real-time updates are not critical, the current system may still be sufficient.

A social RPG game could be the solution, offering continuous gameplay that encourages interaction.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n### Setting\n\nOur game is set in a \"Comfortable Cyberprep\" realm. It merges sci-fi with ease, where tech and humans coexist. Players explore a future city where technology is part of life. The city glows with neon lights, holographic interfaces, and advanced AI, yet retains homeliness.\n\n1. Static couch collider: A fixed location for player interaction.\n2. **Non-functional** Static bed without collider: A rejuvenation spot for characters.\n3. **Non-functional** Mirror that is off: A decorative element with potential uses.\n4. **Non-functional** Video player screen that is off: A feature for entertainment or information.\n\n### Story\n\n1. Chill and hang with friends: The game provides a relaxed environment for socializing.\n2. Play a game: Beyond socializing, players can engage in an RPG game.\n\n### Systems\n\n1. RPG game with level rewards: Players improve through play.\n2. Combat System: Players choose between different types of weapons or defensive items.\n3. Stationary Target Combat System: A mechanism where players engage in combat with fixed-position targets.\n\n### Development Limits\n\n1. Settings are not persisted past server restart.\n2. Limited number of weapon choices: To maintain balance.\n3. Cooldown period for using healing items: To prevent spamming.\n\n## Implementation\n\nImplementation details will be decided upon proposal acceptance.\n\n## Positive Consequences\n\n- Increased user engagement\n- Prolonged interaction within the V-Sekai world\n- Enhanced socialization among players\n\n## Negative Consequences\n\n- Potential increase in development time and resources\n- Risk of unbalanced gameplay if the RPG system is not properly designed\n\n## Option Graveyard\n\nOptions considered but discarded:\n\n- **Idle RPG Mechanic**: Removed due to potential decrease in active engagement from players.\n\n## If this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nThe frequency of use depends on the players' engagement level. However, given the complexity of an RPG system, it cannot be simply worked around with a few lines of script.\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nCreating an RPG system as a feature of V-Sekai will enhance the overall user experience and engagement, which aligns with our goal of providing a compelling virtual world.\n\n## References\n\n- [V-Sekai](https://v-sekai.org/)", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ede3557e-e849-4f05-972a-8fe73d0b47e8": {"__data__": {"id_": "ede3557e-e849-4f05-972a-8fe73d0b47e8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e25a8297-5b7c-4951-a023-2f73120f436b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "af159d544192eb7d234acedd70351f90853b789986fa7268b9ea8ba8a4e514c0"}}, "hash": "af159d544192eb7d234acedd70351f90853b789986fa7268b9ea8ba8a4e514c0", "text": "# Enhancing Map Uploads\n\n## Metadata\n\n- Status: accepted\n- Deciders: V-Sekai, fire, Scipi\n- Tags: V-Sekai\n\n## The Backdrop\n\nV-Sekai is facing limitations in its Elixir uro backend when uploading maps, specifically related to the Godot Engine scenes. These limitations are believed to be caused by a restriction in the Waffles library.\n\n## The Challenge\n\nThe challenge at hand is to address the arbitrary limitations imposed by the Waffles library on the Godot Engine scenes during map uploads in the Elixir uro backend of V-Sekai.\n\n## The Strategy\n\nTo overcome this challenge, we propose patching the Waffles library in collaboration with our new contributor.\n\n## The Upside\n\nBy patching the Waffles library, we can effectively remove the limitations on the Godot Engine scenes and improve the functionality of map uploads in V-Sekai.\n\n## The Downside\n\nIt is important to consider any potential downsides or risks associated with patching the Waffles library. Further analysis and testing may be required to ensure compatibility and stability.\n\n## The Road Not Taken\n\nAlternative solutions to address the limitations have been explored, but patching the Waffles library appears to be the most viable option.\n\n## The Infrequent Use Case\n\nThis limitation impacts the specific use case of map uploads in the Elixir uro backend, and may not affect other functionalities in V-Sekai.\n\n## In Core and Done by Us?\n\nAs a core functionality of V-Sekai, addressing the limitations in the Godot Engine scenes during map uploads is a task that should be done by our team.\n\n## Further Reading\n\n- [V-Sekai](https://v-sekai.org/)\n- This article is assisted by AI.\n- https://github.com/V-Sekai/v-sekai-game/issues/68", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "029afe5c-9c5a-48ff-a259-d014715ed590": {"__data__": {"id_": "029afe5c-9c5a-48ff-a259-d014715ed590", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e4dd75f8-a732-4612-ac6b-a161ce9aae1f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7142442e4fb17dfebd70ba44084c6d3a9ab6e2bcce37f8a871cc99a08ea04eec"}}, "hash": "8598ef6f372d112e2f64f1b385289fa09cb0443f3898846d696d5d9ff94ea4d9", "text": "# Use KVM to test our AMD APU test computer via Barrier.\n\n### Context and Problem Statement\n\nUse KVM to test our AMD APU test computer via Barrier.\n\n### Describe the feature / enhancement and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nBarrier allows us to use the keyboard and mouse transferring commands from Linux to Windows.\n\n### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams\n\nBarrier allows us to use the keyboard and mouse transferring commands from Linux to Windows.\n\n### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nThis is an operating procedure guide.\n\n### Positive Consequences\n\n_No response_\n\n### Negative Consequences\n\n_No response_\n\n### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nThis a guide.\n\n### References\n\n- https://github.com/debauchee/barrier\n\n### Derivative License\n\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

As a test,. I transferred a local animation from one character to an Xbot model, and the animation was broken. See here: left is Global (GLO) which works well. Right is Local (LOC) which has arms and body backwards (image below).\n\nSo the question is: when is Global not good enough? Well, it is not well suited for finger bones. By its very nature, it does not know how finger bones work, since it is working on the \"silhouette\" of the model.\n\nThis means none of these retargeting modes are good enough on their own. So what can we do about it?\n\nPerhaps it is possible to create an importer which twists fingers in the Bone Rest matrix into a configuration suitable for Global retargeting? I can't say whether or not this is possible, but if this could be solved, then maybe we can use Global mode for everything?\n\nIt could be declared that finger bones shall be local, and all other bones shall be global, and everyone making assets should agree on finger rotations. This might not always be possible, but this is my interpretation of reduz's idea of storing the PlaybackMode in Node B in Tokage's diagram.\n\nOr it could be left up to each animation artist / importer which to use, and then you're going to have a mixture of modes. If so, I see two ways to deal with it:\n\nThe animations are stored in global along with skeleton and converted using the source skeleton. This sounds ok in principle if some conversion tool could be made, but I would be afraid to deal with converting animations on the fly at runtime.\n\nThe animations must point to the RetargetOption they were generated with (or a per-track retarget mode), so that these differently sourced animations can be mixed.\n\nfrom what I can understand, \"2\" is what Tokage is proposing. I don't see many other solutions to this. Fundamentally, if it is the case that animations made from different models are needed to be mixed, I don't see a viable solution other than the last one.\n\n![158130997-7582d581-2b3c-45f5-b28f-deb26f2f6ffd](./attachments/158152887-0f91d668-12f0-487a-a217-eb5b38881f9a.png)\n\n### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\n\n- See pull request.\n\n### Positive Consequences\n\n- Sharing animations will make Godot Engine better.\n\n### Negative Consequences\n\n- The feature is hard to do.\n\n### Option graveyard\n\n- Use Blender and other types of retargeting\n\n### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\n- NOT A FEW LINES OF SCRIPT!!!\n\n### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\n- This should be a core feature of Godot Engine.\n\n### References\n\n- [V-Sekai](https://v-sekai.org/)\n- `https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/56902`\n\n### License of the contribution\n\nCopyright (c) 2022 V-Sekai contributors.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f6b2311a-922f-4c3b-a21f-9c607952f30a": {"__data__": {"id_": "f6b2311a-922f-4c3b-a21f-9c607952f30a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9b33c5bb-c12b-4ecd-b447-5a086f3d70f5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e8e329997d3b827af9a81cba6b1d2ef67d0008a58af1104fb62e88bc04ba9493"}, "2": {"node_id": "3b44b55c-a285-4d4d-a80e-af27d456cb0a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a42c655df4975f1d4ffffd8ae9da8eaed7a42dde4a8f6b3d8f9a346de6059715"}}, "hash": "1d6cba73bf77e104f98375ad894850e65c37c2ceb2f3ed6f2bbede05c901b66f", "text": "Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions: The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

However, this would require significantly more work from the creators.\n\n## The Infrequent Use Case  \n\nThis strategy might not be beneficial for very simple models or scenes where the level of detail is not a significant factor.\n\n## In Core and Done by Us?   \n\nYes, this strategy is implemented in the core of our platform and maintained by us.\n\n## Further Reading  \n  \n- [V-Sekai](https://v-sekai.org/)  \n- This article is assisted by AI.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "02799874-ef40-425d-a1b0-258ddccc821c": {"__data__": {"id_": "02799874-ef40-425d-a1b0-258ddccc821c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8ce2e249-24af-4af2-8fa1-282fa0e94fa6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0ffaba9e5ba5864eea457b9c0a5abb0bb8d85c6d975fa7368d204b375c15fb42"}}, "hash": "6c8b3bc29547f7c6cd87e9f48149ea27cabbd8298708b3fa221d4e2b10ad743c", "text": "# Use our custom fullbody IK\n\n### Context and Problem Statement\n\nWe need to animater our characters in game using full body ik.\n\n### Describe the feature / enhancement and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nEWBIK is a full body ik.\n\n### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams\n\nEWBIK\n\n### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nCode is already complicated.\n\n### Positive Consequences\n\n_No response_\n\n### Negative Consequences\n\n_No response_\n\n### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nI and Eron know.\n\n### References\n\n- EWBIK\n\n### Derivative License\n\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

We propose to overcome this limitation by introducing a VR mode.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nOur solution involves creating a VR mode specifically for posing Many Bone IK kusudama constraints. The steps for implementation are as follows:\n\n1. Take an off the shelf VR controller.\n2. Take an off the shelf multiplayer functionality.\n3. Develop a tool selection ui. Collaborate with guillefix.\n4. Adjust the kusudama constraint attributes to match posing.\n5. Save attributes.\n\n### Definition of a Kusudama\n\nImagine you have a ball. There are two ways you can move it:\n\n1. **Twist**: Like spinning a globe on its stand.\n2. **Swing**: Like moving your finger from one spot to another on the ball.\n\nThink of a Kusudama (a type of origami that forms a sphere) as an example for the swing movement. The pieces of paper move just like your finger would on the ball.\n\n## Implementation\n\n1. Investigate Saracen's VR networking prototype.\n1. Rebuild character posing without tracking the physical sensors\n2. Apply Many Bone IK tracking\n3. Rotation swing (10x Vector4)\n4. Rotation twist (From and range)\n5. Adjust for quality\n6. Complete configuration\n\nAssigning physical sensors to IK points is non-goal.\n\n## Option Graveyard\n\n1. **Desktop Mode Enhancement:** Initially, we considered enhancing the desktop mode to handle the kusudama constraints better. However, this option was discarded due to the inherent limitations of the desktop interface for such complex interactions.\n\n2. **Use of External Tools:** Another option was to use external tools or plugins specifically designed for handling Many Bone IK kusudama constraints. This option was rejected because it would require users to learn and manage additional software, which could lead to a fragmented user experience.\n\n3. **Simplified Kusudama Constraints:** We also thought about simplifying the kusudama constraints to make them more manageable on the desktop. But this option was discarded as it would limit the capabilities and flexibility that our platform currently offers.\n\n4. **Automated Posing:** An automated system for posing the kusudama constraints was also considered. However, this option was rejected because it would take away control from the users, potentially leading to less satisfactory results.\n\n5. **Tutorials and Guides:** Providing extensive tutorials and guides to help users navigate the complexity of posing kusudama constraints on the desktop was another option. This was discarded because it doesn't address the core issue - the difficulty of managing these constraints on a desktop interface.\n\n## Negative Consequences\n\n- Increased complexity in game development.\n- Potential need for more resources (time, manpower, etc.) for implementation and testing.\n\n## Option graveyard\n\nThis section is reserved for options considered but rejected.\n\n## If this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nPosing the avatar is the first interaction a user has when entering our virtual world, V-Sekai. This underlines the necessity of investing in this enhancement to ensure a seamless and engaging user experience right from their first interaction with our platform.\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nPose quality is crucial to us. As the creators of V-Sekai, we have an unparalleled understanding of our platform's limitations and potential improvements. This insight puts us in a unique position to enhance the pose quality in a way that aligns with our users' needs and expectations.

This can be a hindrance for users who want to have more control over the appearance of their avatars. To address this, we propose an enhancement that introduces various tools and techniques to overcome these limitations and provide a more comprehensive avatar creation process.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nHere is a list of raw processes to be broken down.\n\n### Avatar Creation Steps:\n\nTo implement the requested changes, here are the modified instructions:\n\n1. **Creating the avatar face:** Utilizes digital drawing techniques to design and create the facial features of the avatar.\n   - Input mime type: None\n   - Output mime type: Digital drawing/image file (e.g., PNG, SVG)\n\n2. **Changing colors:** Utilizes a digital paintbrush tool like Penpot to modify and customize the colors of the avatar.\n   - Input mime type: Digital drawing/image file (e.g., PNG, SVG)\n   - Output mime type: Digital drawing/image file (e.g., PNG, SVG)\n\n3. **Selecting the best-looking avatars:** Evaluates and chooses the most visually appealing avatars from a pool of options.\n   - Input mime type: Digital drawing/image file (e.g., PNG, SVG)\n   - Output mime type: Digital drawing/image file (e.g., PNG, SVG)\n\n4. **Removing the background image:** Removes the background image to make rework easier. May provide worse results with edge details.\n   - Input mime type: Digital drawing/image file (e.g., PNG, SVG)\n   - Output mime type: Digital drawing/image file (e.g., PNG, SVG)\n\n5. **Adding a body:** Incorporates a body to the avatar using Blender's CC0 base mesh or a similar tool.\n   - Input mime type: Digital drawing/image file (e.g., PNG, SVG)\n   - Output mime type: Digital drawing/image file (e.g., PNG, SVG)\n\n6. **Creating a 3D model of the back of the avatar:** If feasible, attempts to create a 3D model of the back of the avatar for a more comprehensive representation.\n   - Input mime type: Digital drawing/image file (e.g., PNG, SVG)\n   - Output mime type: Digital drawing/image file (e.g., PNG, SVG)\n\n7. **Simplifying images:** Uses a tool to simplify and refine the entire avatar image as a whole, removing any unnecessary image details or complexities.\n   - Input mime type: Digital drawing/image file (e.g., PNG, SVG)\n   - Output mime type: Digital drawing/image file (e.g., PNG, SVG)\n\n8. **Adding clothing and accessories:** Enhances the avatar by adding clothing and accessories using tools like Vroid Hub.\n   - Input mime type: Digital drawing/image file (e.g., PNG, SVG)\n   - Output mime type: Digital drawing/image file (e.g., PNG, SVG)\n\n9. **Placing the 2D image as a reference:** Positions the 2D reference image in front of the 3D model to serve as a visual guide during customization.\n   - Input mime type: Digital drawing/image file (e.g., PNG, SVG), 3D model file (e.g., GLTF)\n   - Output mime type: 3D model file (e.g., GLTF), Digital image file (e.g., PNG, SVG)\n\n10. **Capturing and enhancing images:** Captures images from various angles using a camera and enhances them to improve the overall quality.\n   - Input mime type: Digital drawing/image file (e.g., PNG, SVG)\n   - Output mime type: Digital image file (e.g., PNG, SVG)\n\n11. **Generating text captions:** Creates descriptive text captions for the captured images to provide additional context or information.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "be2436bb-084f-4e06-add9-a30c46887858": {"__data__": {"id_": "be2436bb-084f-4e06-add9-a30c46887858", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "dc910fc2-98fc-4b05-a20f-f5e7a5d9f047", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e962c5b332e7b59727c1b56b10b558c85ab0ec59dca9eea12b5a1c44eca3f167"}, "2": {"node_id": "cfc220b3-7409-4760-821f-0637c58ad77a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "af07fbfbdade579032c2ea0d585d3c1dadfafac663e36d7f89a90d730184fb8f"}}, "hash": "0e21d76279853ba2c310631173186192a759156521a83dc73bdfc205d49ed95e", "text": "- Input mime type: Digital image file (e.g., PNG, SVG)\n   - Output mime type: Text file (e.g., TXT)\n\n12. **Using a 2D reference image in Blender:** Uses a 2D reference image within Blender to guide the customization process.\n   - Input mime type: Digital drawing/image file (e.g., PNG, SVG)\n   - Output mime type: 3D model file (e.g., GLTF), Digital image file (e.g., PNG, SVG)\n\n## Positive Consequences\n\n- Users will be able to create highly customizable avatars with specific features.\n- The avatar creation process will be enhanced with a variety of tools and techniques.\n- Detailed customization of colors, clothing, accessories, and facial expressions will be possible.\n- Motion capture capabilities can be integrated for more realistic animations.\n\n## Negative Consequences\n\n- The implementation process is complex and may require advanced technical skills from users.\n- Some steps, like creating a 3D model of the back of the avatar, may not always be successful.\n- Painting errors and other imperfections may remain in the final avatar.\n\n## Option graveyard\n\n- Excessive complexity or technical requirements: We want the avatar creation process to be user-friendly and accessible to a wide range of users, so any options that require advanced technical skills or have excessively complex customization controls will not be included.\n\n## If this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nNo, the proposed enhancement involves a multi-step process that cannot be easily replicated with just a few lines of script.\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nThe proposed enhancement addresses the limitations in V-Sekai's avatar creation process, providing users with a comprehensive solution for creating highly customizable avatars. By implementing these tools and techniques within the platform, V-Sekai can offer a more robust and user-friendly experience for its community.\n\n## References\n\n- [V-Sekai](https://v-sekai.org/)\n- [Detail Tweaker](https://civitai.com/models/58390/detail-tweaker-lora-lora)\n- [InstructBLIP: Towards General-purpose Vision-Language Models with Instruction Tuning](https://github.com/gfodor/instructblip-replicate)\n- [Petals](https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/petals)", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4305e7d8-ba86-4a7d-bf52-96756db258e2": {"__data__": {"id_": "4305e7d8-ba86-4a7d-bf52-96756db258e2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "86cabade-37d2-4c16-ba77-6af11710de9a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "29e5c0fd827521a9e60962df6570167838998bc48c36095808121064e3d6d47d"}}, "hash": "d9a02f0d9c3bee064a06e1743c507a78af7674c01adf5971c5487f5c96ae90e8", "text": "# V-Sekai Roadmap and Goals 2023-06-08\n\n### Metadata\n\n- Status: superseded by `20230618-v-sekai-roadmap.md` <!-- draft | proposed | rejected | accepted | deprecated | superseded by -->\n- Deciders: V-Sekai,fire,lyuma,\n- Tags: V-Sekai,chatgpt4 summary,\n\n### Context and Problem Statement\n\nWhat is the V-Sekai Roadmap and Goals?\n\n### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nThe roadmap presented here is short-term.\n\n### Describe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  subgraph Short Term\n    A[June 08th, 2023] --> D[IK Points for V-sekai]\n    D --> E[Investigate ManyBoneIK & mediapipe to support Facial Mocap to ARKit 52 blendshape and audio to face]\n    E --> F[Elixir mvsqlite Serversidecar]\n    F --> I[Add jitter buffer to godot_speech]\n  end\n  subgraph Mid-term Term\n    D --> E[Vrm upload to the asset library]\n    F --> G[Unidot Unity Import upload to the asset library]\n    G --> H[Add jitter buffer to godot_speech]\n    H --> I[Implement onevoip]\n  end\n```\n\n### Positive Consequences\n\nWe can create V-Sekai easier.\n\n### Negative Consequences\n\nOverhead might be hard.\n\n### Option graveyard\n\n- Implementing a custom voice chat solution instead of using onevoip\n- Waiting for Godot Engine 4.2 instead of assisting with 4.1 features\n- Ignoring SkeletonIK3D issues and focusing on other aspects\n\n### If this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nNo. This is a process.\n\n### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nThis is a core process for V-Sekai.\n\n### References\n\n- [V-Sekai](https://v-sekai.org/)", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "88786c9a-3c1f-491a-b498-ff850c2feb2e": {"__data__": {"id_": "88786c9a-3c1f-491a-b498-ff850c2feb2e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "33739cb6-4fda-41c7-8949-04894f123f2d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "19ea794f6aba770e710ae7642cbe900f3f653b0920a5159066fd360065974f0e"}}, "hash": "e77ffac576109af3993ecb432f48bbfefb16a8cbed0cd284137f4ad2554cda87", "text": "# Improving VR Experience\n\n## Metadata\n\n- Status: proposed\n- Deciders: V-Sekai\n- Tags: V-Sekai\n\n## Introduction\n\nV-Sekai is a virtual reality (VR) platform that offers users the opportunity to immerse themselves in virtual worlds. However, there are certain limitations that hinder the overall user experience. This documentation aims to address these limitations by proposing specific areas for improvement within V-Sekai.\n\n## The Challenge\n\nV-Sekai currently faces several limitations, including non-functional menus in VR mode and a limited number of available worlds. To overcome these challenges and enhance the user experience, we must prioritize and focus on one area for improvement.\n\n### Proposed Solutions\n\n**Improving Object Pickup and Menus**: Enhancing object pickup mechanics and menus can make interactions within V-Sekai more intuitive and user-friendly. This may include refining controls, feedback mechanisms for object pickup, and finding alternative methods to access menus while in VR mode.\n\n## The Strategy\n\nTo ensure efficient use of time and resources, it is advisable to choose one area to focus on and strive to complete it within a two-week timeframe. This focused approach allows for significant progress in improving V-Sekai.\n\n## Upsides\n\nBy addressing these limitations, V-Sekai can offer a more seamless and immersive VR experience. Improving object pickup and menus will enhance user interactions, making them more intuitive and user-friendly. This will ultimately result in a more engaging and enjoyable experience for V-Sekai users.\n\n## Downsides\n\nGiven the limited timeframe, it may not be possible to address all the identified limitations simultaneously. Additionally, the complexity of refining object pickup mechanics and menus may present challenges in achieving substantial improvements within the two-week timeframe. It's important to carefully assess the scope and feasibility of the proposed enhancements before committing to the timeframe.\n\n## The Road Not Taken\n\nWhile focusing on improving object pickup and menus is recommended for the given timeframe, it's important to acknowledge that there are other potential areas for improvement. Exploring options such as expanding the variety of worlds, integrating backend services, or optimizing performance can be considered in future iterations of V-Sekai.\n\n## In Core and Done by Us?\n\nThe development team at V-Sekai should primarily handle the implementation and integration of the chosen improvement. However, collaborative efforts involving developers, designers, and user experience experts may be necessary to ensure the improvements align with the overall vision and goals of V-Sekai.\n\n## Further Reading\n\n- [V-Sekai](https://v-sekai.org/)\n- This article is assisted by AI.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8e869b1f-7da6-4161-9485-f59e5c030376": {"__data__": {"id_": "8e869b1f-7da6-4161-9485-f59e5c030376", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0d196b8a-bcdc-4f9b-94e0-37895d0768c1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2f976c2fc256d44b57649efbf23c15adf67ebe9d0431878c02967ae3fedbbe9c"}}, "hash": "b9e5d86746ba53715820709888c13831448d93991bd6935597911e344eddf153", "text": "# Distribute trusted clients with notary\n\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\nWe use itch.io distribute our software clients.\n\n1.

Now, we want to build a similar editor for the iPad so that people can upload game worlds and avatars from a tablet. However, due to iOS limitations, it's impossible to run multiple instances of the app or restart the app on non-jailbroken devices. Therefore, we need to adapt the existing codebase to work within these constraints.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n1. Adapt the existing MacOS editor codebase for the iPad without relying on multi-process architecture.\n2. Test the application on various iPad models to ensure compatibility and performance.\n\n## Implementation\n\n1. Clone the existing iPhone Godot Engine editor repository.\n2. Create a new branch for the iPad version.\n3. Modify the codebase to avoid using multi-process architecture:\n   1. Change almost all global states (probably except UIApplication and view controller) to thread-local.\n   2. Run multiple Godot instances in threads instead of processes.\n4. Implement the editor, import project folder, and export PCK to the filesystem. Our project requires SCN uploads to a web CDN.\n5. Test the application on different iPad models and fix any issues found during testing.\n   1. Install Xcode.\n   2. Generate certificates.\n   3. Upload the Godot Engine iPad build to the iPad.\n6. Merge the iPad branch back into the main branch once the application is stable and fully functional.\n\n## Positive Consequences\n\n- Expanding the availability of the MacOS editor to iPad users.\n- Reusing the existing codebase, reducing development time and effort.\n\n## Negative Consequences\n\n- Additional development and testing efforts required to support another platform.\n- Potential maintenance overhead due to supporting multiple platforms.\n\n## Option graveyard\n\n- Developing a separate iPad-only application from scratch.\n- Using web-based editor solutions instead of a native app.\n- Implementing a remote desktop solution to access a MacOS editor on a different device.\n- Porting the MacOS editor to a cross-platform framework, potentially sacrificing performance and native features.\n\n## If this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nNo, this enhancement requires significant changes to the existing codebase to properly support the iPad.\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nYes, as the maintainers of Godot Engine, we have the expertise and knowledge of the codebase to efficiently adapt it for the iPad.\n\n## References\n\n- [V-Sekai](https://v-sekai.org/)\n- [iPad fork of of Godot Engine](https://github.com/V-Sekai/godot/tree/groups-4.x-ios)", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8a662979-dc11-4ec3-84ae-1d52f6ad4b20": {"__data__": {"id_": "8a662979-dc11-4ec3-84ae-1d52f6ad4b20", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f273395a-237d-43da-888b-7acc7f9761fd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a86876d5b50ff310fc5979f52ccc71da7a1c310030f3c62b4b60e83d3e2af9bd"}}, "hash": "a86876d5b50ff310fc5979f52ccc71da7a1c310030f3c62b4b60e83d3e2af9bd", "text": "# Handling access to session based game data\n\n## Metadata\n\n- Status: proposed\n- Deciders: V-Sekai\n- Tags: V-Sekai, GPT-4\n\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\nV-Sekai is facing limitations in handling large amounts of data efficiently and securely.

State Locking Model\n\nTo reduce complexity, latency, and processing power, we have created a simple Mastership/Ownership model.\n\nClients are defined as individuals connecting to a Server, they have their own v-sekai game instance running.\n\nThe Relay Server, as of now, does not contain information about the state of the world, the only information the Relay Server contains is on Mastership/Ownership rules.\n\n```\nP1 connects to the Server.\n\nP2 connects to the Server.\n\nP3 connects to the Server.\n\nP1 spawns in a Ball.\n\nServer marks that P1 has both Mastership and Ownership of Ball.\n\nServer synchronizes with P1 and sends the state of the Ball to P2, its location, rotation, the very fact of its existence, and its owner, master, and rule.\n\n```\n\nServer State\n\n| Objects | Master | Owner | Rule |\n| ------- | ------ | ----- | ---- |\n| Ball    | P1     | P1    | Ask  |\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\n#### Ownership\n\nSince P1 is the Owner of the Ball, this means that P1 is the only one who can change the state of the ball. When Server synchronizes, if P2 were to have the ball in a different location then P1, the Server would tell P2 that the Ball is in the location P1 has it, and would do the same for P3. It can be thought of as a _mutex_ on the state of the Ball. Whoever holds the Mutex is the one who can modify the state therein. This also means that all calculations for game state are split up among all the players, every player only has to run code modifying what they own, which in large scale player events would otherwise increase exponentially with custom scripts for each player's props or avatars.\n\n#### Mastership\n\nThis presents a problem however, how could P2 take the Ball from P1? The solution is Mastership. Whoever is the Master can change who is the Owner at any time. The Master also can change whatever the default Rule is, which is what the Server, and Client references when looking to change Ownership to itself (or someone else?).\n\n- Ask: Take a round trip to the Master and back to the Server so the Master can decide based on external factors whether or not to allow ownership transfer or deny it. This could be used for example, if someone only wants a gun to be grabbable if they are a \"shooter\" and not if they are a \"civilian\"\n- Deny: You cannot ask for ownership transfer, good for things like Avatar's transform node, you don't wanna be involuntarily moved around, or for the root of the world map.\n- Allow: You can ask for ownership any time, and it is automatically granted.\n\n### Tweaks\n\nWe can change the rate of synchronization based on the closest clients owned model, and other things like that, there are a lot of areas for optimization when it comes to using this.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "13237f16-f323-481f-9ac7-c0a3b8fcea19": {"__data__": {"id_": "13237f16-f323-481f-9ac7-c0a3b8fcea19", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b127c167-64d7-4f0f-9a7f-b7046d171792", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5f701d4db81add3a90953ed11f3e5b87dc2f8853d80d02d27adfba5c360b4328"}, "2": {"node_id": "f3daa10d-6c5a-4d7d-b587-1be00b452ed6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "31923009760842d11070d46b1816310689538010286ba32c885da62612ead4f8"}}, "hash": "a29c10098c49d62c204557e720e1977b0a4afb32433f3369759b4e9bf97b6cc8", "text": "## Positive Consequences List\n\n- Low Latency for Competitive/Real-Time interactions\n- Low processing power on both the server and client side\n- Broad enough to be easily modifiable for optimizations in the future without changing the model\n\n## Negative Consequences List\n\n- Complexity, we will have to code this all from scratch basically\n- Multi-user interactions become impossible on a single object, at least to do simply, some smart coding could get around it but it isn't easy to do.\n- Resolutions for the _allow_ rule could lead to inconsistencies, such as two different people picking up a gun and firing it, and two resulting bullets being spawned from the same gun before it gets removed from one individual.\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nAbsolutely, this is the foundation of basically everything content wise in V-sekai.\n\n## References\n\nhttps://github.com/V-Sekai/V-Sekai.github.io/blob/master/decisions/2020/20200729-entity-networking.md\n\nMalek's forum post on networking in the Discord server.\n\n## Derivative License\n\nCopyright (c) 2022 V-Sekai contributors.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Implementing it as a core feature ensures that it is well-integrated, maintainable, and scalable.\n\n## References\n\n- [V-Sekai](https://v-sekai.org/)", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "78543f10-7137-4555-9154-7a584b4d79a8": {"__data__": {"id_": "78543f10-7137-4555-9154-7a584b4d79a8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a6d274b2-bcf2-4a13-850a-c9ab90165fca", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a558d3f7c39c776f7da51b764b1f02f96839ae690ddda5e646010b2ccd75d388"}, "3": {"node_id": "da6e2b81-c23a-4ae7-85ea-f42bee5a02b2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "41bbf0b4120bfecabd11a704742cd7361351f8ca3f7ec81c638a4eef273aeadd"}}, "hash": "dd8eb932e450b9455eece070bcfac22f08cd7fcda6c12a7d71f1489f6f73f4ee", "text": "# Bake alembic imports by running blender script.\n\n### Context and Problem Statement\n\nWant to bake alembic imports to gltf blend shapes.\n\n### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nWe run a python script in Blender to bake alembic inputs to gltf2.\n\n### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\n\n```python\n# MIT LICENSE\n# Authored by iFire#6518 and alexfreyre#1663\n# This code ONLY apply to a mesh and simulations with ONLY the same vertex number\n\nimport bpy\n\n#Converts a MeshCache or Cloth modifiers to ShapeKeys\nframe = bpy.context.scene.frame_start\nfor frame in range(bpy.context.scene.frame_end + 1):\n    bpy.context.scene.frame_current = frame\n\n    # For alembic files converted to MDD and loaded as MeshCache.\n    bpy.ops.object.modifier_apply_as_shapekey(keep_modifier=True, modifier=\"MeshCache\")\n\n    # For cloth simulations inside blender using a Cloth modifier.\n    #bpy.ops.object.modifier_apply_as_shapekey(keep_modifier=True, modifier=\"Cloth\")\n\n# Loop through shapekeys and add as keyframe per frame.\n# https://blender.stackexchange.com/q/149045/87258\nframe = bpy.context.scene.frame_start\nfor frame in range(bpy.context.scene.frame_end + 1):\n    bpy.context.scene.frame_current = frame\n\n    for shapekey in bpy.data.shape_keys:\n        for i, keyblock in enumerate(shapekey.key_blocks):\n            if keyblock.name != \"Basis\":\n                curr = i -

However, there are certain limitations that hinder the overall user experience. This documentation aims to address these limitations by proposing specific areas for improvement within V-Sekai.\n\n## The Challenge\n\nV-Sekai currently faces several limitations, including non-functional menus in VR mode and a limited number of available worlds. To overcome these challenges and enhance the user experience, we must prioritize and focus on one area for improvement.\n\n### Proposed Solutions\n\n**Exploring Backend Services Integration**: Integrating V-Sekai with backend services can enhance the platform's features and capabilities. This could involve incorporating external APIs or services to provide additional resources and functionalities.\n\n## The Strategy\n\nTo ensure efficient use of time and resources, it is advisable to choose one area to focus on and strive to complete it within a two-week timeframe. This focused approach allows for significant progress in improving V-Sekai.\n\n## Upsides\n\nBy addressing these limitations, V-Sekai can be transformed into a more immersive and engaging VR platform. Enhancing menus and object pickup mechanics, expanding the variety of worlds, or integrating backend services can greatly enhance the overall user experience for users.\n\n## Downsides\n\nGiven the limited timeframe, it may not be possible to address all the identified limitations simultaneously. Prioritizing one area means that other aspects may need to wait for future improvements. Additionally, the complexity of the chosen area may present challenges in achieving substantial improvements within the two-week timeframe.\n\n## The Road Not Taken\n\nWhile focusing on one area is recommended for the given timeframe, it's important to acknowledge that there are other potential avenues for improvement. Exploring options such as performance optimization, improving UI design, or implementing additional features can be considered in future iterations of V-Sekai.\n\n## In Core and Done by Us?\n\nThe development team at V-Sekai should primarily handle the implementation and integration of the chosen improvement. However, collaborative efforts, involving developers, designers, and technical writers, are essential for documenting the enhancements.\n\n## Further Reading\n\n- [V-Sekai](https://v-sekai.org/)\n- This article is assisted by AI.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c8e13392-a0ca-4559-aadf-35672dd05311": {"__data__": {"id_": "c8e13392-a0ca-4559-aadf-35672dd05311", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3021f612-1a44-448a-be1d-6cfefad97790", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ead5cd85b7dbe535342c38c3130345e65121cf1e4fd5fa4abb6481cfaf937a93"}, "3": {"node_id": "26526f5e-ae2d-471c-ab31-f48c99b30933", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c692608f9178c854960cdd69c301f9fefcd5dd08379c5a04786d1f4f9da0df02"}}, "hash": "304b0e48c3d3112996c46b52bb87e1eb55f3c06098bb772bb457d20c98f87c7d", "text": "# Minimum Specification V-Sekai Hardware\n\n### Context and Problem Statement\n\nTags: hardware proxy, minimum spec,\n\nWe want to create standardized performance numbers for V-Sekai.\n\nPerformance targets:\n\n1.

Python will not be used in this context.\n- **Speech-to-Text Interface**: A speech-to-text interface will be incorporated to process voice inputs effectively.\n- **Direct Connection to Compute Module**: The display, set in portrait mode, will connect directly to the compute module, a standard Linux amd64 computer, eliminating the need for embedded software development.\n- **Flexible OLED Display**: The system will utilize a 6-inch flexible OLED display from Wisecoco with a resolution of 2880\\*1440 at 60Hz refresh rate.\n- **No Holograph Displays**: The design will be streamlined and efficient, excluding holograph displays.\n\n## Potential Challenges\n\nThe project's complexity and the expertise required in areas such as GGML, the Godot engine, and AI development pose significant challenges.\n\n## Alternatives Not Considered\n\nWe have decided against integrating Python with GGML and using a pre-existing AI framework instead of developing one from scratch.\n\n## Target Audience\n\nThe project may not be suitable for individuals without familiarity with GGML or a background in AI development.\n\n## Development Strategy\n\nThe project will be developed in-house, utilizing our expertise in AI and game development.\n\n## Further Reading\n\nFor more information, please refer to these resources:\n\n- [V-Sekai](https://v-sekai.org/)\n- [GGML on GitHub](https://github.com/georgi-gerganov/ggml)\n- [Whisper JAX on GitHub](https://github.com/sanchit-gandhi/whisper-jax)\n- [Twitter inspiration](https://twitter.com/jav6868/status/1698260873352212662?s=20)\n- [wisecoco 6 inch 2K Flexible OLED Display IPS 2880 \\* 1440 Flexible Screen Curved Bendable Screen](https://www.amazon.ca/wisecoco-Flexible-Display-Screen-Bendable/dp/B0C7YY16Z5)\n\n## System Diagram\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\nA[Edge Device: Compute Unit] -->|Hosts| B[VRM1 Character Layer]\nC[Whisper for Speech-to-Text running on GGML] -- Audio Processing --> B\nB --> D[Wisecoco 6-inch Flexible OLED Display in Portrait Mode]\nE[Microphone] -- Audio Input --> C\n```\n\n## System Diagram Explanation:\n\n### 1. Edge Device: Compute Unit (A)\n\nThis unit is a standard Linux amd64 computer that hosts the VRM1 Character Layer (B).\n\n### 2. Whisper for Speech-to-Text module (C)\n\nThis module, running on GGML, captures audio input from the Microphone (E) and converts it into text.\n\n### 3. VRM1 Character Layer (B)\n\nThe processed data from the Whisper module animates a virtual character in this layer. The character can be in speaking or idle mode.\n\n### 4. Wisecoco 6-inch Flexible OLED Display in Portrait Mode (D)\n\nThe resulting texts are displayed on this screen.\n\n> **Note:** Currently, the system only supports speaking and idle states. Other modes are not available.\n\nThe choice of portrait mode for the display aligns with the specific needs and constraints of the project. As the project heavily relies on text-based interactions, specifically transcriptions, portrait mode allows more lines of text to be visible at once, thereby improving the user experience.\n\nThe system utilizes a 6-inch flexible OLED display from Wisecoco. Portrait mode is more space-efficient in such scenarios, taking up less horizontal space while still providing ample vertical space for text display.\n\nGiven that the primary focus of the project is voice interactions, the display mode should ideally support easy reading of transcriptions. Portrait mode, with its vertical orientation, is more suited to this task as it mimics the natural top-to-bottom reading flow.\n\nAccording to the system diagram, the processed data from the Whisper for Speech-to-Text module running on GGML is used to animate a virtual character and display the resulting texts.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template":

They are looking for an ideal jitter-buffer implementation that can handle both slowing down and speeding up played audio.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nUse the adaptive jitter buffer from the Speex source code as a starting point, with modifications to address its limitations:\n\n1. Capture packets as they are being dropped from the jitter buffer.\n2. Ensure all captured packets are played.\n3. Implement a playback buffer to speed up the audio when necessary.\n\n## Implementation\n\n1. Integrate the adaptive jitter buffer from the Speex source code into the godot-speech project.\n2. Modify the jitter buffer to capture dropped packets and store them in a separate buffer.\n3. Implement a playback buffer that accelerates audio playback when more audio packets are available.\n4. Test the new implementation to ensure it handles jitter compensation effectively.\n\n## Positive Consequences\n\n- Improved jitter compensation in the voice chat solution.\n- Better handling of packet drops and audio acceleration.\n- Enhanced overall audio quality in the voice chat system.\n\n## Negative Consequences\n\n- Additional complexity in the godot-speech codebase.\n- Potential performance impact due to the added buffering mechanism.\n\n## Option graveyard\n\n- Continue using the current rudimentary jitter-buffer implementation in godot-speech.\n\n## If this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nNo, this enhancement is essential for a high-quality voice chat solution and cannot be easily worked around with a few lines of script.\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nYes, improving the jitter-buffer implementation is crucial for providing a reliable and high-quality voice chat experience in V-Sekai projects.\n\n## References\n\n- [V-Sekai](https://v-sekai.org/)\n- [godot-speech](https://github.com/V-Sekai/godot-speech)\n- [Speex](https://www.speex.org/)", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "43aac6bb-51d8-4fae-be1c-6a8bbe4f9030": {"__data__": {"id_": "43aac6bb-51d8-4fae-be1c-6a8bbe4f9030", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e44e6593-95dd-48d3-b757-e817081406e4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b3c169aa3a3cbf906f5988709ea2af6ca47fe1c704bcf02e48018c044ce7fb51"}}, "hash": "c8b084ad4de891f991fa0017e3a546e35078525aab289f89aa124e38eb00ce5e", "text": "# Rank skeleton bone names by using BPR\n\n- Status: proposed\n\n### Context and Problem Statement\n\nImprove automatic bone selection\n\n### Describe the feature / enhancement and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nUse brp to rank bones while storing in duckdb.\n\n### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams\n\nUse duckdb and brp.

We need a system that allows garments to be easily applied to various avatars without manual rigging each time a new garment or avatar is created.\n\n## Describe the problem or limitation you have in your project, e.g., in free form, using two to three sentences. Consider articulating the case in the form of a question.\n\nHow can we create a system that allows garments to be easily applied to various avatars without the need for manual rigging each time a new garment or avatar is created?\n\n## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nImplement an automated rigging and wrapping system using known base meshes and garments for easy application of garments to avatars without manual rigging.\n\n## Describe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\n\n1. **Create avatar and garment models**: Create a 3D model representing the basic shape and structure of an avatar without any clothing or accessories, and a 3D model of a piece of clothing or accessory.\n2. **Rig models**: Rig the avatar and garment models by creating a skeleton structure that defines how they move and deform. Use the Blender Dem Bones add-on to automate the rigging process.\n3. **Generate cage mesh**: Generate a simplified \"cage\" mesh around the avatar base mesh using the Simplicage add-on. This cage will be used to help apply the garment to the avatar.\n4. **Attach garment to cage**: Attach the garment model to the cage created in the previous step, so that it follows the cage's movement and deformation.\n5. **Conform garment to avatar**: Utilize the Mesh Materializer add-on to conform the garment model to the avatar base mesh, using a UV texture map to guide the wrapping process. This ensures the garment fits correctly on the avatar.\n6. **Manage multiple layers**: Develop a system to manage multiple layers of clothing or accessories on the avatar, allowing for proper layering and interaction between clothing items.\n\n## Positive Consequences\n\n- Reduced manual rigging efforts for each garment and avatar combination\n- Streamlined process of applying garments to avatars\n- Easier customization and creation of new avatars with various garments\n\n## Negative Consequences\n\n- Additional development time required to implement the automated system\n- Potential compatibility issues with existing assets or workflows\n- Dependent on third party addons\n  * Research and evaluate alternative solutions or develop custom tools to replace or supplement the functionality provided by these third-party add-ons. This will help ensure long-term stability and maintainability of the project.\n- Performance concerns with complex avatars and garments\n  * Optimize the algorithms used in the automated rigging and wrapping process to handle complex models efficiently. Additionally, consider implementing a level of detail (LOD) system to reduce the complexity of models during runtime without compromising visual quality.\n- Difficulty in handling edge cases. \n  * Develop a set of guidelines for creating avatar and garment models that work well with the automated system. Additionally, provide manual intervention options for users to fine-tune the rigging and wrapping results in case of edge cases.\n\n## Option graveyard\n\n- Relying solely on creators is inefficient; they need tools.\n\n## If this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nNo, this enhancement requires a more complex solution involving multiple tools and processes.\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nThis enhancement requires a complex solution involving multiple tools and processes, and cannot be worked around with a few lines of script. Implementing this feature as part of the core functionality will greatly improve the user experience and streamline the process of creating and customizing avatars with different garments.\n\n## References\n\n- [V-Sekai](https://v-sekai.org/)\n- [Blender Dem Bones](https://blendermarket.com/products/blender-dembones)\n- [Simplicage](https://blendermarket.com/products/simplicage)\n- [Mesh Materializer](https://blendermarket.com/products/mesh-materializer)", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "74ac3369-95ff-45ed-baec-e9301224d055": {"__data__": {"id_": "74ac3369-95ff-45ed-baec-e9301224d055", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6da968f4-f4c8-4ac9-aa5c-97822416cc21", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e5ecc03396c99d8a87e7b87f1a58e86929fe335602d25ed49c9bae780b3854ab"}}, "hash": "c4dd08123d6d525165edd94e3ab61ce5c09d3c203f53f607e65530897ac0cfc7", "text": "# Propose a solution to improve V-Sekai contributors' design skills for navigating 3D environments\n\n## Metadata\n\n- Status: proposed\n- Deciders: V-Sekai\n- Tags: V-Sekai, GPT-4\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nV-Sekai contributors lack the knowledge to create decent designs for navigating complex 3D environments with obstacles and walls, limiting user experience and potential applications.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nDevelop a comprehensive training program for V-Sekai contributors that focuses on designing effective navigation systems for complex 3D environments.\n\n## Implementation\n\n1.

Punch Line\n\nThis is where you present the facts related to the game development process. For example:\n\n```markdown\n\"The AI behavior for enemy characters wasn't completed on time, and we didn't start the level design for Stage 3 as planned.\"\n```\n\nor\n\n```markdown\n\"Completed the character modeling as scheduled.\"\n```\n\n### 2. Current Status\n\nIn this step, you explain how the punch line affects the game development project. For instance:\n\n```markdown\n\"Because of the incomplete AI behavior, the game testing has been delayed by a week.\"\n```\n\n### 3. Next Steps\n\nHere, you propose solutions to the problem if there are any. An example could be:\n\n```markdown\n\"I will be able to complete the AI behavior in the next four days but the level design for Stage 3 will still be behind schedule.\"\n```\n\n### 4. Explanation\n\nFinally, you provide the reasons behind the punch line. This is where you can give a detailed account of why things happened the way they did. For example:\n\n```markdown\n\"Three days' delay in AI behavior is due to an unexpected bug in the pathfinding system, and the remaining delay is due to being called to assist the graphics team with texture optimization.\"\n```\n\n## The Upside\n\nThe upside of this strategy is that it allows for clear and concise communication within the team. It ensures that everyone is aware of the current status of the project and what needs to be done moving forward.\n\n## The Downside\n\nThe downside is that it requires all team members to be diligent in their reporting. If someone fails to accurately report their progress or issues, it could lead to miscommunication and delays in the project.\n\n## The Road Not Taken\n\nAn alternative approach could have been to use traditional reporting methods, where each team member provides a detailed report of their work. However, this method can often lead to information overload and important details may get lost in the process.\n\n## The Infrequent Use Case\n\nThis strategy may not be as effective in smaller teams or projects where communication is more direct and less formal.\n\n## In Core and Done by Us?\n\nYes, this strategy should be implemented by us as it aligns with our goal of improving communication and project management within the team.\n\n## Further Reading\n\n- [V-Sekai](https://v-sekai.org/)\n- [I'm OK; The Bull Is Dead](https://www.computerworld.com/article/2565077/i-m-ok--the-bull-is-dead.html)\n- This article is assisted by AI.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "18806104-4f13-4488-b35b-89e97c6beaf8": {"__data__": {"id_": "18806104-4f13-4488-b35b-89e97c6beaf8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a6a00917-7b34-484a-9d40-82b17e602c41", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c6c5d9387e06042f2d56a3ded5d5d4319bad081bf4b47b95729d25dd6e46b08b"}}, "hash": "098687cbbb638cb3b4570654ee4969b689d78987bce5833e8d3853390fc77ea1", "text": "# Notify community members and users about activity and updates via a Discord bot\n\n- Status: draft\n\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\nWe want a way to notify community members and users about activity and updates.\n\n## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nA discord bot would be able to inform users via Discord about updates and changes.\n\n## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\n\nWe would connect to Discord API from Elixir using one of several integration libraries.\n\nWe can report #information such as server player count by editing a message; or updating the bot status.\n\nI would also like to poll #information such as CI/CD builds and deployments.

If this doesn't look right, choose a different type.\n\nImprove the 3D import functionality in Godot Engine for V-Sekai by enhancing the existing import process and adding support for more file formats.\n\n***This proposal is rejected because it doesn't improve the 3D import functionality compared to its effort***\n\n## Metadata\n\n- Status: proposed\n- Deciders: V-Sekai\n- Tags: V-Sekai, GPT-4\n\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\nV-Sekai has implemented `.fbx` and `.gltf` 3D import, and `.obj` is already part of Godot Engine. However, there is still room for improvement in the import process and support for additional file formats. The current Blender importer for Godot Engine 4.0 requires an additional installation and injects a Python script into Blender.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n1. Develop an addon that can simultaneously export colliders, occluders, and LOD variants for a given mesh without requiring an additional Blender importer.\n2. Enhance the existing import process by providing better error handling, reporting, and automatic fixes for common issues.\n3. Improve the performance of the import process, especially for large and complex 3D models.\n\n## Implementation\n\n1. Create an addon that automatically searches for and sets Geometry Nodes input constants with relevant names (e.g., `is_occluder`, `is_collider`, and `LOD`) while exporting, giving modelers maximum flexibility on how different versions of a mesh should be exported. This addon should not require an additional Blender importer or Python script injection.\n2. Update the import pipeline to handle errors gracefully and provide helpful feedback to users.\n3. Optimize the import process by implementing caching, parallel processing, and other performance improvements.\n\n## Positive Consequences\n\n1. Users will have more control over the export process, allowing them to easily manage colliders, occluders, and LOD variants without needing an additional Blender importer.\n2. The improved import process will reduce the time spent on fixing import-related issues.\n3. Faster import times will lead to a smoother development experience.\n\n## Negative Consequences\n\n1. Developing an addon may require additional resources and maintenance.\n2. There might be potential licensing issues with integrating third-party libraries.\n\n## Option Graveyard\n\n1. Relying solely on community plugins for additional import functionality.\n2. Limiting support to only a few popular file formats.\n\n## If this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nNo, this enhancement addresses a core limitation in the engine and requires significant changes to the import pipeline.\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nYes, improving the 3D import functionality is essential for providing a better user experience and supporting a wider range of 3D modeling tools. It also ensures that V-Sekai remains competitive with other game engines.\n\n## References\n\n- [V-Sekai](https://v-sekai.org/)", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0d78abd0-c2e1-4d9a-bcca-431aea2a7b98": {"__data__": {"id_": "0d78abd0-c2e1-4d9a-bcca-431aea2a7b98", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fedc8421-6893-42e3-a9c5-4de294a3a52f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ceddce0f3cec1af90d51fd80536dfdf1601a41d20b9fed5a43198cfe664636d7"}}, "hash": "fdbdc68f25c8045a6ef7e7ac65982f93e9da484b745b12f21938e89fea260741", "text": "# V-Sekai Roadmap and Goals 2023-05-19\n\n### Metadata\n\n- Status: superseded by `20230527-v-sekai-roadmap.md` <!-- draft | proposed | rejected | accepted | deprecated | superseded by -->\n- Deciders: V-Sekai,fire,lyuma,\n- Tags: V-Sekai,chatgpt4 summary,\n\n### Context and Problem Statement\n\nWhat is the V-Sekai Roadmap and Goals?\n\n### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nThe roadmap presented here is short-term.\n\n### Describe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  subgraph Short Term\n    A[May 16th, 2023] --> C[Assist Tokageit with Godot Engine 4.1 features before May 30th feature freeze]\n    B --> D[Assist Godot Engine 4.1 features before May 30th feature freeze]\n    C --> E\n    D --> E[Vrm upload to the asset library after May 30th, 2023]\n    E --> F[Unidot fix import bugs that blocked assets import]\n    F --> G[Unidot Unity Import upload to the asset library after May 30th, 2023]\n    G --> H[Implement onevoip]\n  end\n```\n\n### Positive Consequences\n\nWe can create V-Sekai easier.\n\n### Negative Consequences\n\nOverhead might be hard.\n\n### Option graveyard\n\n- Implementing a custom voice chat solution instead of using onevoip\n- Waiting for Godot Engine 4.2 instead of assisting with 4.1 features\n- Ignoring SkeletonIK3D issues and focusing on other aspects\n\n### If this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nNo. This is a process.\n\n### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nThis is a core process for V-Sekai.\n\n### References\n\n- [V-Sekai](https://v-sekai.org/)", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4e873489-47a0-4dc1-8fbc-8e58b23a7d78": {"__data__": {"id_": "4e873489-47a0-4dc1-8fbc-8e58b23a7d78", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0351105d-be55-4d57-88b9-47e046d1b33a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "4128e0237125578bd312affe2573ea9b8fab786496b6236c374156d87cbf7932"}}, "hash": "4128e0237125578bd312affe2573ea9b8fab786496b6236c374156d87cbf7932", "text": "# Game simulation server sidekick process\n\n## Metadata\n\n- Status: proposed \n- Deciders: V-Sekai\n- Tags: V-Sekai, Godot Engine, khepri, elixir\n\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\nWe want to provide each game server a sidekick process that restarts Godot Engine on crash and acts as a local processor before upload to the source of truth backend database. This will ensure continuous gameplay and data integrity.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nWe propose to use khepri for sidekick server data with an elixir frontend.\n\nKhepri provides robustness and reliability while Elixir offers scalability and fault-tolerance.\n\n## Implementation\n\n1. Develop a sidekick process using khepri that monitors the Godot Engine.\n2. In case of a crash, the sidekick process should be able to restart the Godot Engine.\n3. The sidekick process should also act as a local processor for game data before it's uploaded to the backend database.\n4. Implement an Elixir frontend to interact with the sidekick process.\n\n## Positive Consequences\n\n- Improved game server stability.\n- Continuous gameplay even in the event of a crash.\n- Ensured data integrity before upload to the backend database.\n\n## Negative Consequences\n\n- Additional development time and resources required.\n- Potential complexity in managing the sidekick process.\n\n## Option graveyard\n\n1. **Using a simple watchdog script:** A simple script that monitors the Godot Engine and restarts it in case of a crash. This was rejected due to its inability to act as a local processor for game data before upload.\n\n2. **Relying on third-party services:** There are several third-party services that offer process monitoring and automatic restarts. However, these were rejected due to potential issues with customization, cost, and data privacy.\n\n3. **Building a custom solution from scratch:** While this would give us the most control, it was deemed too resource-intensive and unnecessary given the existence of suitable tools like khepri and Elixir.\n\n4. **Do nothing:** The option to maintain the status quo was considered but ultimately rejected due to the negative impact on user experience and data integrity.\n\n## If this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nNo, this enhancement is fundamental to the stability of the game servers and cannot be achieved with a simple script workaround.\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nYes, as this directly impacts the user experience and the integrity of our game data, it is crucial that we have full control over its implementation and maintenance.\n\n## References\n\n- [V-Sekai](https://v-sekai.org/)\n<!-- - This article [is / or is not] assisted by AI. -->", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3cdce28e-8dec-4ed4-98a0-c0e996777e12": {"__data__": {"id_": "3cdce28e-8dec-4ed4-98a0-c0e996777e12", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3ede793a-89ac-4d57-a298-7667285dc951", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "188e01c6fb1baa5fbec54aaebc7d16b732ad48d09b73e8789bee1566c4f40fde"}}, "hash": "adb32d4789c199ae5253fa2d197e516426ae9d81826ada10884c17e7aa985d11", "text": "# Material Addon Blender\n\n### Context and Problem Statement\n\nWant to bake procedural materials to Godot Engine that change based on input\n\n### Describe the feature / enhancement and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nImplement a Material Addon for Blender\n\n### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams\n\n1.

The current implementation relies on GDScript or C++ native modules, which may not offer the desired performance, user agency, complex calculations, graphics rendering, and algorithm execution.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nV-Sekai utilizes WebAssembly (Wasm) to enhance performance, offering an alternative to GDScript.\n\n### Ownership\n\n- Core modules: Owned by V-Sekai\n- Custom modules: Owned by users\n\n### Security\n\nUser-uploaded Wasm modules undergo a two-step process for safety and unauthorized access prevention:\n\n1. **Validation**: Ensure module structure and integrity adhere to security standards.\n2. **Sandboxing**: Confine modules in a secure environment, restricting system resource access and mitigating potential harm.\n\n### Functionality\n\nWasm modules facilitate advanced functions in virtual worlds and avatar-based social games, such as:\n\n- Efficient character animations\n- Interactive environments\n- Real-time multiplayer networking\n- Immersive gameplay experiences\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe proposed solution uses WebAssembly (Wasm) to enhance performance and functionality in V-Sekai through User-Generated Content (UGC) Wasm modules. These modules are attached to an existing base node as a script, enabling them to provide property data and behavior for nodes in the virtual world or game.\n\nHere's a concise explanation of the implementation:\n\n1. **User uploads a Wasm module**: Custom Wasm modules with desired functionality are uploaded to V-Sekai.\n2. **Attach Wasm module to a node**: The Wasm module is attached to a node as a script, providing advanced functionality for the node.\n5. **Implement behavior within the Variant dictionary**: Node behavior is defined within script variable, enabling Wasm modules to provide both property data and behavior.\n6. **Utilize Godot's set_script property**: Using Godot's `set_script` property, Wasm modules are attached to nodes and objects, simplifying dependency handling.\n7. **Properties after the set script**: Adding properties directly onto the node after the script = property is set\n\nThis approach ensures graceful handling of missing resources while offering advanced functionality through user-uploaded Wasm modules.\n\n## Positive Consequences\n\n- Improved performance for complex calculations, graphics rendering, and algorithm execution\n- Greater user control over scripts and customization\n- Enhanced functionality for virtual worlds and avatar-based social games\n\n## Negative Consequences\n\n- Potential security risks with user-uploaded Wasm modules\n- Increased complexity in implementation and maintenance\n- Ensuring a wasm module has no defects is difficult with or without source code.\n\n## Option graveyard\n\n1. **Optimizing GDScript**: Improving the performance of GDScript was considered, but it would not provide the same level of performance boost as WebAssembly.\n2. **Using a different scripting language**: Alternative scripting languages like Lua or Python were considered, but they also do not offer the desired performance improvements compared to WebAssembly.\n3. **Native code integration**: Integrating native code (C++, Rust, etc.) directly into V-Sekai was considered, but it would increase complexity and maintenance efforts. Additionally, it would not provide the same level of security and sandboxing as WebAssembly.\n\n## If this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nNo, the enhancement aims to provide a significant performance boost and advanced functionality that cannot be achieved with a few lines of script.\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nYes, integrating Wasm into V-Sekai's core ensures optimal performance and seamless integration with existing systems.\n\n## References\n\n- [V-Sekai](https://v-sekai.org/)\n- [ashtonmeuser/godot-wasm/issues/43](https://github.com/ashtonmeuser/godot-wasm/issues/43)\n- This article was assisted by AI.\n\n## Glossary\n\nHere's a glossary of definitions to help people understand the terms used in the Wasm in V-Sekai proposal:\n\n1. **WebAssembly (Wasm)**: A type of code that is more portable than regular code, making games and virtual worlds work better.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "91ebb316-3f0f-4719-860e-5397a9199de7": {"__data__": {"id_": "91ebb316-3f0f-4719-860e-5397a9199de7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "35346abb-22bb-43f6-baa1-19d1d2e6c89d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e0073af7343b4a93134eeae29067711a8e402696226c70e694c26983df244208"}, "2": {"node_id": "e6ce55de-5fce-4d59-9ca6-4d507a03e15a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3fdf4f0cbdfb5e22d547032afb236a66ead214fdf125041de1f94576bbad2586"}}, "hash": "5a65fbd7954a0e80a9fe711aafff0148a35fabbe1904a8fb04433fe7d093c5fd", "text": "Originally made for the web.\n\n2. **GDScript**: A programming language used to make games and apps in the Godot game engine.\n\n3. **C++ native modules**: Pieces of code written in the C++ programming language that can be added to a game or app to make it work better.\n\n4. **V-Sekai**: A platform for creating virtual worlds and avatar-based social games.\n\n5. **Metadata**: Information about something, like who made it and what it's for.\n\n6. **Validation**: Checking if something is correct and follows the rules.\n\n7. **Sandboxing**: Putting something in a safe area where it can't cause harm or access things it shouldn't.\n\n8. **User-Generated Content (UGC)**: Things that people who use a game or app create themselves, like characters, levels, or stories.\n\n9. **MissingNode**: A part of the game or app that needs a script to tell it what to do.\n\n10. **MissingResource**: Something that a game or app needs but doesn't have yet, like an image or sound.\n\n11. **Variant**: A data type in Godot that can store different kinds of information, like numbers, text, or objects.

A line graph shows the progress of an animation over time, while a scatter plot shows the data points that were used to create an animation.\n\nA line graph can help you debug physics interpolation issues. If your object's position is not moving smoothly, you can look at how it moved over time and see if there are any sudden changes or jumps in its motion that might be causing problems. This will help you determine whether you need to adjust your physics simulation or tweak some other aspect of your game design.\n\nSecond, you can use scatter plots to visualize how different variables interact with each other. For example, if you have an object that's supposed to move along a straight line but instead moves in a curved path, then it might be helpful for you to see whether there are any correlations between its position and its velocity. This will help you isolate which variables are causing this behavior so that you can optimize them individually or together.\n\n### Positive Consequences\n\nWe are able to use V-Sekai easier.\n\n### Negative Consequences\n\nWe cannot get other features in.\n\n### Option graveyard\n\n- Option: The status quo. <!-- List the proposed options no longer open for consideration. -->\n- Rejection Reason: This solves nothing. <!-- List the reasons for the rejection: (the bad traits) -->\n\n\n### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nEasy chart is a gdscript addon but it is not trivial to reimplement.\n\n### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nMotion posing is a core feature.\n\n### References\n\n- [V-Sekai](https://v-sekai.org/)\n- [Easy Charts](https://github.com/fenix-hub/godot-engine.easy-charts)", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ea5a202c-feac-4dd7-b164-d99ba784fe77": {"__data__": {"id_": "ea5a202c-feac-4dd7-b164-d99ba784fe77", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "24df6877-667c-4223-b0ad-111f9ecaa6e3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3e20adae8b1942f4a2b1503b54c197a7a9c7cac8e9ed9d6d3cf7d7295f0178e0"}}, "hash": "bcc5f2da7429dc2b9be72966a327ab0b4a4ffb87595a4e85c4e62f27b69c3300", "text": "# V-Sekai Navigation Compatibility with VR\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **Status:** Proposed\n- **Deciders:** V-Sekai\n- **Tags:** V-Sekai, iPad, Presentation Screen, Compatibility\n\n## The Backdrop\n\nWe are developing a VR game that MUST be compatible with a wide range of devices. Our goal is to make our VR game accessible and enjoyable for this vast majority of users.\n\n## The Challenge\n\nThe challenge is to ensure the game's user interface and controls work seamlessly across these different display sizes and touch interfaces.\n\n## The Strategy\n\nWe considered two options: Virtual joystick for touchscreen devices and Navmesh and 3D navigation points. We chose the \"Virtual joystick for touchscreen devices\" because it addresses the core issue of ensuring compatibility with iPads and large projector screens, and it is more cost-effective.\n\n## The Upside\n\n- Improved user experience across different devices and screen sizes.\n- Increased versatility of the game, making it suitable for various applications.\n- Enhanced navigation in 3D spaces.\n- More cost-effective solution.\n\n## The Downside\n\n- Potential increase in development time and costs.\n- Additional resources for testing on different devices and screens.\n\n## The Road Not Taken\n\nNavmeshes and 3D Navigation Points are tools used to define traversable spaces in a 3D environment. However, they might not be suitable when the spaces aren't already defined, such as grids. Waypoints have similar limitations.\n\nIn Godot, any modification triggers a rebuild of the entire navigation map. If the map is large and complex, this rebuilding process can take a significant amount of time and lead to performance issues.\n\n## The Infrequent Use Case\n\nWhile Navmesh and 3D Navigation Points provide an intuitive user interface for navigating 3D spaces, they might not translate well to continuous interaction on touchscreens, which is often expected by users on such devices.\n\n## In Core and Done by Us? \n\nYes, the decision to implement a virtual joystick for touchscreen devices was made by us, V-Sekai. This decision is at the core of our strategy to ensure compatibility with iPads and large projector screens while also being cost-effective.\n\n## Further Reading\n\n- [V-Sekai](https://v-sekai.org/)\n- This article is assisted by AI.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e1a90eef-978c-4153-8cb2-8f3e8bd78355": {"__data__": {"id_": "e1a90eef-978c-4153-8cb2-8f3e8bd78355", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "afea8a49-d871-4b94-9402-878ee0b1ee92", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f4b9eb335d655ebecb061e9cdfe2ddec3904ef17bfb549bef3f88a2ab26122ba"}}, "hash": "69eab6394c415285943bb4cdb27cc321d67ed6a2016b6fab795ad3fed94fda89", "text": "# To make it easier to upload V-Sekai maps and Avatars use Godot Engine 4 script templates.\n\n- Status: accepted <!-- draft | rejected | accepted | deprecated | superseded by -->\n- Deciders: V-Sekai,fire,saracen\n- Tags: V-Sekai,\n\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\nUploading V-Sekai maps and Avatars is complicated.\n\n## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nUse the new Godot Engine feature of script templates to make it easier to upload.\n\n## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\n\n1.

The challenge is to find a way to make marketing more manageable and effective for V-Sekai.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n1. Strategy\n2. Positioning\n3. Messaging\n4. Experimentation\n\nThe first three steps are initial preparations that create a strong foundation for marketing efforts. The fourth step, Experimentation, is a recurring process that helps us continuously improve our marketing strategies.\n\n## Implementation\n\n### Step 1: Strategy\n\nDefine the overall marketing strategy by identifying target audiences, setting goals, and determining the best channels to reach potential customers.\n\n### Step 2: Positioning\n\nEstablish a unique selling proposition (USP) that sets the product or service apart from competitors. This will help potential customers understand why they should choose the offering over others in the market.\n\n### Step 3: Messaging\n\nDevelop clear and compelling messaging that communicates the USP and resonates with the target audience. This messaging should be consistent across all marketing channels.\n\n### Step 4: Experimentation\n\nConduct regular experiments to test and refine marketing tactics. This can include A/B testing, trying new channels, or adjusting messaging. Analyze the results of these experiments and use the insights gained to improve future marketing efforts.\n\n## Positive Consequences\n\n- Improved marketing effectiveness for V-Sekai\n- Better time management and prioritization of tasks\n- Increased revenue and business growth\n\n## Negative Consequences\n\n- Potential initial time investment in setting up the marketing habit\n- Possible resistance to change or adopting new habits\n\n## Option graveyard\n\nDo nothing.\n\n## If this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nNo, this marketing strategy is a comprehensive marketing approach that requires ongoing commitment and cannot be replaced by a simple script.\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nYes, as the creators and maintainers of V-Sekai, we have the best understanding of our product and target audience. By taking charge of our marketing efforts, we can ensure that our messaging and strategies align with our goals and vision, ultimately leading to better results.\n\n## References\n\n- [V-Sekai](https://v-sekai.org/)\n- [Material from 2quiet2market](https://2quiet2market.com)", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "26730b9f-1b86-4a3b-b8d2-51d66eb5de20": {"__data__": {"id_": "26730b9f-1b86-4a3b-b8d2-51d66eb5de20", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a4fc08b5-e06b-4907-8f74-3fb045136e43", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a7f2c97913a5c748e762648d63a7350febc970f12cac065385fd18bcd6b4eea5"}}, "hash": "3a3baae5831b00c375f59c0d51c6400cc67f7b98bb01447ec1c9afaeb88ed4dd", "text": "# Planning V-Sekai Version 3 on 2022-02-28\n\n- Status: accepted <!-- draft | rejected | accepted | deprecated | superseded by -->\n- Deciders: V-Sekai,ifire,lyuma,\n- Tags: V-Sekai,\n\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\nKnow where we're going by describing what we want.\n\n## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nProposed mission and a list of tasks.\n\n## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\n\n### To further the development of Godot and open source tech\n\n- Godot Engine pull requests.\n\n### To build a tech stack and service for interactive multiplayer VR games.\n\n- Improve making and using avatar and map content enhancement\n- Able to have our group of people join and communicate (godot speech) enhancement\n- Restore VR support (openxr) in V-Sekai enhancement\n- Test easier with desktop interaction with objects enhancement\n- Interact with objects in vr enhancement\n- Import a CCBY, CC0 MMD stage for testing dance stages enhancement\n- Provide user generated scripting using WasGo enhancement\n\n## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\nGain clarity of mission.\n\n## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- The cost of overhead.\n\n## Option graveyard: <!-- same as above -->\n\n- Option: Status quo. <!-- [List the proposed options no longer open for consideration.] -->\n- Rejection Reason: Complete the wrong thing. <!-- [List the reasons for the rejection: (the Bad traits)] -->\n\n## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nThis is a planning document.\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nWe know what we want to do.\n\n## References <!-- optional and numbers of links can vary -->\n\n- None\n\n## Derivative License\n\nCopyright (c) 2022 V-Sekai contributors.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

To ensure the platform meets user needs and expectations, we have identified several features that need to be implemented. These features have been categorized based on their priority and necessity for the initial release.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nThe features have been organized into three categories: Must-Have, Nice-to-Have, and Out of Scope Initially. The priority within each category reflects the relative importance of the features for an initial release.\n\n### Must-Have Features\n\n| Priority | Feature | Dependencies |\n|:--------:|:-------|:------------|\n|    1     | Environment (scene loading, world hosting, instancing) | None |\n|    2     | Web requests to servers (HTTP/WebSocket API) | Environment |\n|    3     | Person to person interaction (avatars, animation, synchronization) | Environment |\n|    4     | Interaction with the world (interactive elements, physics) | Environment |\n\n### Nice-to-Have Features\n\n| Priority | Feature | Dependencies |\n|:--------:|:-------|:------------|\n|    5     | Collaboration features (doodling, modeling, content loading) | Environment, Person to person interaction |\n|    6     | Static content creation in editor (import avatars, create worlds) | Environment |\n|    7     | Shareable content (inventory) | Environment, Static content creation in editor |\n|    8     | Local API for extending platform | Environment, Web requests to servers |\n|    9     | Video playback | Environment |\n|   10     | Support for proprietary video hosting | Video playback |\n\n### Out of Scope Initially\n\n| Priority | Feature | Dependencies |\n|:--------:|:-------|:------------|\n|   11     | Text chat | Environment, Person to person interaction |\n|   12     | Screen sharing (OBS) | Environment, Person to person interaction |\n|   13     | Modeling and 3D Creation (Blender) | Environment, Static content creation in editor |\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe implementation details will be determined once the proposal is accepted and the features are finalized.\n\n## Positive Consequences\n\n- A well-structured and prioritized feature list will guide development efforts.\n- Clear categorization helps manage stakeholder expectations about what will be included in the initial release.\n\n## Negative Consequences\n\n- Some features may require more time and resources than initially estimated.\n- Stakeholders may have different opinions on the priority of certain features.\n\n## Option Graveyard\n\nThis section will include any options considered but ultimately rejected during the decision-making process.\n\n## If this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nThis question will be addressed during the implementation phase for each feature.\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nAs these features form the core functionality of the V-Sekai platform, they should be developed by our team to ensure quality and consistency.\n\n## References\n\n- [V-Sekai](https://v-sekai.org/)", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "01b17e8e-4a27-4aa3-b11c-638215668054": {"__data__": {"id_": "01b17e8e-4a27-4aa3-b11c-638215668054", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "36d101bf-afd3-43f1-ad58-589049585f08", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "4c751dd7dba1009c8c06729522b955e22ac22f00918133e31f64c7102d5369c3"}}, "hash": "1fa97bdd6aee682e0cd826c9604a49d9969b44531d0fd94ace392c8f461096ce", "text": "# Polish demo of V-Sekai by making invisible meshes appear via the use of the exporter.\n\n- Status: proposed <!-- draft | rejected | accepted | deprecated | superseded by -->\n- Deciders: V-Sekai,\n- Tags: V-Sekai,\n\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\nPolish the demo of V-Sekai\n\n## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nWe want to validate the V-Sekai exporter addon works.\n\n## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\n\n1.

This has led to difficulties in synchronizing updates and maintaining consistency across different components of the project.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nWe propose to continue maintaining separate repositories for each addon, but use Git subrepo to merge them into the main V-Sekai game repository. This would result in the following structure:\n\n```bash\nv-sekai-game\n\u2502\n\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500addons\n    \u2502\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500vrm (from godot-vrm/only-addon)\n    \u2502\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500Godot-MToon-Shader (from Godot-MToon-Shader)\n```\n\nThis way, all addons will be part of the main game repository but can still be managed independently.\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe implementation will involve the following steps:\n\n1. Changes are made in the respective addon repositories.\n2. These changes are then merged into the main V-Sekai game repository using Git subrepo.\n\nThis ensures that the addons remain up-to-date with their respective repositories.\n\n## Positive Consequences\n\n- Streamlined workflow for managing addons.\n- Easier synchronization of updates across different components of the project.\n- Reduced complexity in project management.\n\n## Negative Consequences\n\n- Initial setup may require some time and effort.\n- Developers will need to adapt to the new workflow.\n\n## Option graveyard\n\nPreviously, we considered maintaining separate repositories for each addon without using Git subrepo. However, this approach was discarded due to the difficulties in synchronizing updates and maintaining consistency across different components of the project.\n\n## If this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nNo, this enhancement is fundamental to the project structure and cannot be worked around with a few lines of script.\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nYes, this change affects the core structure of our project and should therefore be implemented by us to ensure consistency and control over the project.\n\n## References\n\n- [V-Sekai](https://v-sekai.org/)", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1547a523-ccba-4410-a0cb-6c473df48adf": {"__data__": {"id_": "1547a523-ccba-4410-a0cb-6c473df48adf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "492cac82-206b-4b66-8a66-f668d98c2960", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "78453d1a65aaf2377a929ee8c0556bb7ef11e4dd2fcbb8d1fd877d886b0d0626"}, "3": {"node_id": "2403f79a-056c-49dd-816d-95569b08ed47", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "751f9c2c22c945882ba699fca192f145c1eb2134831c8986e1d0e88992570319"}}, "hash": "04976cee69d787b75c8a4b28e05b8c67e1b5950d44adab1df7e09ce39c4bac70", "text": "# File or attestation for virtual worlds using ssh signatures\n\n- Status: rejected <!-- draft | rejected | accepted | deprecated | superseded by -->\n- Deciders: V-Sekai,\n- Tags: V-Sekai,\n\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\nFile or attestation for virtual worlds\n\n## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nUse ssh signatures.\n\n## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\n\nAn analogy of a CD and a CD case with stickers.\n\n### File attestation\n\nRead your public key.\n\n```\n$ ssh-add -L > me.pub # Can be related to a X.509 `.crt`\n```\n\nCreate a file.\n\n```\n$ touch avatar-sample.vrm\n```\n\nSign your file.\n\n```\nssh-keygen -Y sign -f <(ssh-add -L) -n \"avatar@v-sekai.org\" < avatar-sample.vrm >> avatar-sample.vrm.avatar%40V-sekai.com.sig\nssh-keygen -Y sign -f <(ssh-add -L) -n \"me@v-sekai.org\" < avatar-sample.vrm >> avatar-sample.vrm.me%40V-sekai.com.sig\n```\n\nWrite signature to avatar-sample.vrm.sig # Can be attested by multiple people with multiple `.sig`.\n\n```\necho -n ernest.lee@chibifire.com | cat -

As the project grows in complexity, it becomes increasingly important to ensure that the system is thoroughly tested and can handle various scenarios. One of the challenges faced by the V-Sekai team is the lack of diverse and realistic data for testing purposes. This limitation hinders the ability to identify potential issues and optimize the system's performance.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nTo address the limitations in testing the V-Sekai system due to the lack of diverse and realistic data, this proposal suggests generating random text data for testing purposes.\n\n### Implementation\n\nWe will use a tool like [Chance.js library](https://chancejs.com/) to generate random text data for testing purposes and use the database.\n\n#### Text Processing\n\nFor generating random sentences, we will use something like the following method:\n\n```javascript\nchance.sentence();\n```\n\nReference: [Chance.js Sentence](https://chancejs.com/text/sentence.html)\n\n#### User Data\n\nFor generating random user names, we will use something like the following method:\n\n```javascript\nchance.name();\n```\n\nReference: [Chance.js Name](https://chancejs.com/person/name.html)\n\n#### Database Operations\n\nWe will perform the following SQL operations on the `user` and `chat` tables:\n\n1. SELECT All Data in Table\n2. SELECT LIKE Data based on %NA%\n3. SELECT Specific Row Data\n4. INSERT\n5. UPDATE\n6. DELETE\n\n##### Tables\n\n**Table user**\n\n| id | username | password | updated_on | created_on |\n\n**Table chat**\n\n| id | user_id | name | text | updated_on | deleted_on | created_on |\n\n#### SQL Function\n\nWe will create a SQL function to check if the username/password match and return 'OK'. We will also check if the query returned is 'OK' and add false information randomly in the nodes to signify a user doing invalid calls for production testing.\n\nThe implementation will generate 90 days of data, generating 100,000 text data entries for testing purposes.\n\n## Positive Consequences\n\n- Improved testing capabilities with diverse and realistic data\n- Enhanced system reliability due to thorough testing\n- Identification of potential issues before they impact users\n\n## Negative Consequences\n\n- Additional development time required to implement the solution\n- Potential increase in storage requirements for generated data\n\n## Option Graveyard\n\n1. **Using static test data**: This option was considered for simplicity, but it would not provide the diverse and realistic data needed for thorough testing.\n\n2. **Manual data generation**: This option involved manually creating test data, but it was deemed time-consuming and inefficient compared to using a library like Chance.js.\n\n3. **Third-party data generation services**: While there are external services that can generate random text data, using them would introduce dependencies and potential costs. Implementing our a solution similar to Chance.js allows for better control over the process.\n\n4. **Crowdsourcing test data**: This option involved gathering test data from users or volunteers. However, it raised concerns about data privacy, consistency, and quality.\n\n## If this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nNo, this enhancement is essential for thorough testing and cannot be easily worked around with a few lines of script.\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nYes, addressing the V-Sekai limitation is crucial for ensuring the system's reliability and performance. Implementing this solution internally allows for better control over the testing process and data generation.\n\n## References\n\n- [V-Sekai](https://v-sekai.org/)", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e913476e-7276-4736-8da6-1f384f06aa03": {"__data__": {"id_": "e913476e-7276-4736-8da6-1f384f06aa03", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1649ef13-d9f6-40fa-bbaf-6833c6120010", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "48fbf64e772c678f07a063454d3c48c81ffd196661ca92643ce8805e671b9e91"}}, "hash": "2ee70b35b2831f1359835252f1790eedb55b1f1449cd575340b53a35bdcb5d96", "text": "# Use #materialx for asset interchange\n\n### Context and Problem Statement\n\nUse #materialx for asset interchange\n\n### Describe the feature / enhancement and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nI was challenged to assemble a green IKEA chair with #materialx https://github.com/KhronosGroup/3DC-Certification/tree/main/models/GreenChair by humbletim.\n\n### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams\n\n1. bake #materialx\n2. add gltf2 extension\n3. create an IO/Blender\n4. create an IO/Godot\n\n### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nThis is so complicated.\n\n### Positive Consequences\n\n_No response_\n\n### Negative Consequences\n\n_No response_\n\n### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nI am championing this workflow.\n\n### References\n\n- materialx.org/\n\n### Derivative License\n\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Go to `https://github.com/V-Sekai/godot`\n2. Make sure the 4.0 branch is synced with `https://github.com/godotengine/godot`\n3. Create a branch.\n   - Let's use an example like `vsk-pmx`.\n4. Switch to the branch.\n5. Run `git subrepo clone https://github.com/V-Sekai/godot-pmx modules/pmx` in the terminal or command prompt.\n6. Code the module.\n7. Run `git subrepo pull modules/pmx` in the terminal or command prompt to merge with upstream repo.\n6. Code the module.\n8. Run `git subrepo push modules/pmx` in the terminal or command prompt to publish.\n9. Make sure GitHub CI/CD tests pass.\n\n## Positive Consequences\n\n- Seamless integration of the PMX module into the V-Sekai project\n- Improved functionality and features for users\n- Easier maintenance and updates for the module\n\n## Negative Consequences\n\n- Potential increase in complexity and dependencies\n- Possible performance impact if not optimized properly\n\n## Option graveyard\n\n1. **Manual integration of the PMX module**: Instead of using `git subrepo`, manually copy and integrate the PMX module into the V-Sekai project. This option is less efficient and harder to maintain, as it requires manual updates and synchronization with the original PMX repository.\n\n2. **Using Git Submodules**: Use `git submodule` to include the PMX module in the V-Sekai project. While this approach allows for easier updates and maintenance, it can be more complex to set up and manage compared to `git subrepo`.\n\n3. **Creating a separate plugin**: Develop the PMX module as a standalone plugin that users can install and enable in their projects. This option reduces the complexity of the core V-Sekai project but may result in less seamless integration and increased setup effort for users.\n\n4. **Forking the Godot Engine**: Fork the entire Godot Engine and directly modify its source code to include the PMX module. This option is not recommended, as it would make it difficult to keep the fork updated with upstream changes and could lead to compatibility issues.\n\n## If this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nThis enhancement cannot be easily worked around with a few lines of script, as it involves integrating a new module into the core project.\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nIntegrating the PMX module into the core project ensures that it is maintained and updated alongside the main project, providing a consistent and reliable experience for users.\n\n## References\n\n- [V-Sekai](https://v-sekai.org/)", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0fbe603a-ab39-4a9a-8e14-12893c6cac36": {"__data__": {"id_": "0fbe603a-ab39-4a9a-8e14-12893c6cac36", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5dc7b495-9017-47e5-874a-1e83ba9c3f5f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "34ba8a5b7b6948939c59d22a1ec12c822561a8f60d98163fc64f3727ffeb541f"}}, "hash": "29012e0383dc949c9972aef027fb95a74268bd116122408a9e3651468c4efdd9", "text": "#  Capturing accurate body movements with limited tracker placement\n\n### Metadata\n\n- Status: superseded by `20230602-limited-tracker-placement.md` <!-- draft | proposed | rejected | accepted | deprecated | superseded by -->\n- Deciders: V-Sekai,fire,\n- Tags: V-Sekai,\n\n\n### Context and Problem Statement\n\nIn our current VR project, we face the challenge of capturing accurate body movements for both soccer and dancing experiences with a limited budget. How can we prioritize the placement of a limited number of trackers to ensure a realistic and immersive experience for both activities?\n\n### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nThe proposed option involves prioritizing tracker placement for the head, hands, hips, and feet, as they are essential for both soccer and dancing experiences. This approach allows for an effective trade-off between tracking accuracy and budget constraints while ensuring a satisfactory level of immersion in both activities.\n\n### Describe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\n\n1. Head: At the base of the neck to monitor head rotation and tilt.\n2. Left Hand: On the left wrist to track the overall motion of the left hand.\n3. Right Hand: On the right wrist to track the overall motion of the right hand.\n4. Hips: A tracker on the hips to monitor lower body movement.\n5. Left Foot: A tracker on the left foot to capture left foot movement, essential for both soccer and dancing.\n6. Right Foot: A tracker on the right foot to capture right foot movement, also crucial for both activities.\n\nAs the budget permits, additional trackers can be incorporated into the setup to further enhance tracking accuracy, particularly for the upper body and leg movements. This expansion can be achieved by following the prioritized list of additional trackers below:\n\n7. Chest: A tracker on the chest to monitor upper body rotation, providing more detailed information about the user's torso movements.\n8. Left Shoulder: A tracker on the left shoulder to track upper arm rotation, allowing for more precise tracking of arm movements during soccer and dancing.\n9. Right Shoulder: A tracker on the right shoulder to track upper arm rotation, complementing the left shoulder tracker for better arm movement tracking.\n10. Left Knee: A tracker on the left knee to track left leg movement, enhancing the realism of leg movements and providing more accurate feedback for actions like kicking in soccer or complex footwork in dancing.\n11. Right Knee: A tracker on the right knee to track right leg movement, mirroring the benefits of the left knee tracker for a balanced leg movement representation.\n\nBy gradually adding these trackers to the initial setup, the overall tracking accuracy of the system will be improved. This will result in more natural and immersive interactions within the VR environment, leading to a more satisfying user experience for both soccer and dancing activities.\n\n### Positive Consequences\n\n- Effective use of a limited budget while maintaining immersive experiences.\n- The solution caters to both soccer and dancing activities in VR.\n- Flexibility in adding more trackers as budget permits.\n\n### Negative Consequences\n\n- Reduced tracking accuracy for upper body and leg movements compared to a setup with more trackers.\n- Potential limitations in supporting advanced features or interactions in VR.\n\n### Option graveyard\n\nCamera-based tracking: Utilizing external cameras to track body movements without the need for wearable trackers. While this approach can be cost-effective, it may not provide the same level of accuracy and precision as wearable trackers, particularly for fast and complex movements in soccer and dancing. Additionally, camera-based tracking can be sensitive to lighting conditions and may require a specific setup to function optimally.\n\nCamera-based tracking might be a viable solution if budget constraints are severe, but it is essential to consider the potential trade-offs in terms of tracking accuracy and reliability compared to wearable trackers.\n\n### If this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nNo, as the proposed solution deals with hardware configuration and the strategic placement of physical trackers to balance budget and immersion.\n\n### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nYes, ensuring an immersive VR experience with a limited budget is a fundamental challenge that requires expertise in tracker placement and prioritization.\n\n### References\n\n- [V-Sekai](https://v-sekai.org/)", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ac27f103-9afe-483f-8396-232a87ab892f": {"__data__": {"id_": "ac27f103-9afe-483f-8396-232a87ab892f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4fb80a45-93cc-4aa0-ae7d-682c7d572e3d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5842a1081be0c937340cd8cfd4c28da6c1238848cd07fdf621e8ed303b88e57f"}, "3": {"node_id": "d031c9d0-b718-42c4-8169-bedba754f64b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1362db76f69b457e27e9639f57c603259897705c767b1917cca71aca65421fe2"}}, "hash": "fcaf40dd02797299ccc583f32744fbf822bebf3838c556d3811cee49fb0bed3e", "text": "# Simulate larger 3d multiplayer worlds using \"brickworlds partition layout\"\n\n- Status: draft <!-- draft | proposed | rejected | accepted | deprecated | superseded by -->\n- Deciders: V-Sekai,Fire,Groak,\n- Tags: V-Sekai,\n\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\nEach V-Sekai game server has a scalability limit.

Implement \"An Algorithm for Triangulating Multiple 3D Polygons\"\n1. Use Godot's delaunay tetrahedralize https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/96d7bc62af25b85b8b9cc091eeea1e7a784ba624/core/math/delaunay_3d.h#L145 `static Vector<OutputSimplex> tetrahedralize(const Vector<Vector3> &p_points)`\n1. Emilie Yu described a method for smoothing meshes.\n\nLibigl should be best for smoothing while pinning the boundaries. I see they have a solver that can take fixed boundary constraints https://libigl.github.io/tutorial/#quadratic-energy-minimization so that could allow you to pin the boundaries. So instead of this line it would be something like\n\n```c++\nigl::min_quad_with_fixed_data mqwf;\nigl::min_quad_with_fixed_precompute(S, [flat vector of indices of boundary vertices size=(3 * N_boundary)], [zero matrix], true, mqwf);\nigl::min_quad_with_fixed_solve(mqwf, M * U, [flat vector of boundary vertices positions size=(3 * N_boundary)], [zero vector], Z);\n```\n\nand the `vector Z is a (3 * N) flat vector` of the solution vertices (equivalent to the \"U\" of the other example).\n\n1. ??? Add remeshing.\n1. Expose a function to Godot Engine called triangulate boundaries.\n\n## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- Jeana demonstrated the feel of CASSIE on 2021-11-05 to draw a cat.\n\n![20211105 CASSIE Jeana](./attachments/20211105-CASSIE-Jeana.jpg)\n\n## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- Adding complexity and maybe time space explosions because of mesh processing.\n- May cause stuttering in VR.\n\n## Option graveyard: <!-- same as above -->\n\n- Option: Integrate drawing like OpenBrush. https://github.com/icosa-gallery/open-brush\n- Rejection Reason: The feel is not the same.\n\n## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nNot a trivial gdscript and has performance gaps.\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nIt is cool and I know how to approach implementing CASSIE in Godot Engine.\n\n## References <!-- optional -->\n\n- https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~taoju/zoum/projects/TriMultPoly\n- https://em-yu.github.io/\n- https://ns.inria.fr/d3/CASSIE\n- https://libigl.github.io/\n- https://github.com/godotengine/\n- https://www.blender.org/\n\n## Derivative License\n\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "76a7b570-0518-46bd-a745-734e513f449a": {"__data__": {"id_": "76a7b570-0518-46bd-a745-734e513f449a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5e4d3e00-4726-4959-880c-ae36f60b9a97", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b32bd4e862e8e27546de16b77eda1e0c76916f898621d567de8020778cbbe933"}, "2": {"node_id": "9e0dd9e9-ff71-41a4-bbe2-0cd0c981c867", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "8482ee08b9e41bfe33c29d8766215acf90ed110cdebd350c797988666bf2628b"}}, "hash": "b29bbe3648bc0fbbed1307af6b98820967b50716ae8c3e78a526e244cb88ef74", "text": "Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

This allows the team to focus on the core aspects of V-Sekai and achieve the goals more efficiently.\n\n1. **Monitoring and Logging System Test**:\n    1. Setup logging framework\n    2. Configure monitoring system\n    3. Create a dashboard\n\n2. **Test Environment with Simulated Data Test**:\n    1. Create test scenarios\n    2. Generate simulated data\n    3. Configure test environment\n    4. Execute test scenarios\n    5. Analyze test results\n\n### Positive Consequences\n\n- Easier creation of V-Sekai.\n- Focused development on core aspects.\n\n### Negative Consequences\n\n- Potential overhead challenges.\n\n### Option graveyard\n\n- Waiting for Godot Engine 4.2 instead of assisting with 4.1 features.\n\n### If this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nNo. This is a process.\n\n### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nThis is a core process for V-Sekai.\n\n### References\n\n- [V-Sekai](https://v-sekai.org/)", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bf0e17b6-d339-4cc1-ab16-e9eee0b0d98e": {"__data__": {"id_": "bf0e17b6-d339-4cc1-ab16-e9eee0b0d98e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "20748a5c-3dc1-4a08-aa98-2a38e099f5c7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "113fdc28ae3bc94f951750053814c53197d799f48dcf0b0d8127604aeb74d2bd"}}, "hash": "5efdee668d07acbe03c515e344701d31965ade5cbc6c1fbbbdfdfcca62d844c0", "text": "# Play preprocessed #animation on any VRM model\n\nSuperseded\n\nThis is now a Godot Engine 4.0 core feature. https://godotengine.org/article/animation-retargeting-in-godot-4-0/\n\n### Context and Problem Statement\n\nGiven any vrm and a carefully made animation, we should be able to play back the animation.\n\n### Describe the feature / enhancement and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nNeed to work out a flow for making #animation play back on vrm.\n\n**This is dependency for a VRM based character controller that can play existing #animation clips and blend them**\n\n### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams\n\n???\n\nCollaborate with Saracen on a bone roll corrected VRM skeleton.\n\nConvert #animation to VRM named bones.\n\n### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nNot trivial.\n\n### Positive Consequences\n\n_No response_\n\n### Negative Consequences\n\n_No response_\n\n### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nWe control the default #animation tree, therefore we need to do this.\n\n### References\n\n- Proposal on baking blend shapes to linear skin blending.\n- Useful for tokage's character movement demo. https://github.com/TokageItLab/3d-platform-test-for-godot4\n- Free #animation -- https://github.com/V-Sekai/shadermotion-video-to-anims\n\n### Derivative License\n\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

One gitlab repo with source assets? (sky celebration and sponza).\n\n- The ability to upload maps and avatars standalone via a SDK (set of submodules?) https://github.com/V-Sekai/vsk_sdk.\n  - Being able to enter a vsk map \u2200 maps (mvp = 1 map).\n  - Enter a vsk map with an entity in it (upload sky celebration OR upload sponza with one beachball).\n- VSK_map source asset repositories\n- Lyuma will make a new github repo V-Sekai/vrm_submodule - we need a script for updating all submodules to the latest on a given branch.\n- VSK_map source asset repositories\n- I think vsk_sdk should only be submodules, no assets.\n- We can git rebase -i to remove the binary assets from it.\n- git merge to install the vsk_sdk into another project (such as gitlab). we need to look if git subtree supports .gitmodules and we can use it if it does.\n- make vsk_sdk the head for all of the sdk related submodules. do our development there and commit submodules regularly.\n- In groups project, pretend we delete all submodules in vsk_sdk. Then git merge vsk_sdk/main to bring in the submodules from that repo.\n- Every time we update vsk_sdk, do a git merge into groups and our source asset repo with sponza etc.\n- VSK_map source asset repositories\n  - Don't save .scn assets in git.\n    - no GLB.\n    - blend files ~10MB ok. > 100MB let's either use GitLab LFS or something else.\n    - Evaluate https://dvc.org/\n\n2. Being able to have our group of people join and communicate. (godot speech).\n\n- Porting C++ was discussed as a way forward to make it easier to debug\n\n4. VR support (openxr).\n5.

However, there are still issues that need to be resolved.\n\n## The Strategy\n\nWe have identified several areas of concern and have charted them in the following flow diagram:\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    Crash[\"V-Sekai crash on start on RADV, Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish) #115\"]\n    VR[\"VR doesn't work #228\"]\n    Avatar[\"Restore avatar upload #243\"]\n    Uploads[\"Restore world uploads #244\"]\n    Mirror[\"Restore mirror in the preview server #249\"]\n    Freeze[\"Pressing escape button while ingame freezes client #250\"]\n    Escape[\"Escape button in menu should go back, instead does nothing #251\"]\n    Text[\"UI dropdown text is invisible until hovered #252\"]\n    Sensitivity[\"Increase default mouse sensitivity #253\"]\n    Gestures[\"Restore gestures #254\"]\n    VOIP[\"Restore VOIP #255\"]\n    IK[\"IK errors ingame #256\"]\n\n    Crash-->VR\n    VR-->Avatar\n    Avatar-->Uploads\n    Uploads-->Mirror\n    Mirror-->Freeze\n    Freeze-->Escape\n    Escape-->Text\n    Text-->Sensitivity\n    Sensitivity-->Gestures\n    Gestures-->VOIP\n    VOIP-->IK\n```\n\n## The Upside\n\nAddressing these issues will significantly improve the user experience, making our game more enjoyable and accessible. This could lead to an increase in our user base and community engagement.\n\n## The Downside\n\nThe process of resolving these issues may require significant time and resources. It might also involve some trial and error, which could potentially introduce new bugs or problems.\n\n## The Road Not Taken\n\nIgnoring these issues is not an option as it would negatively impact the user experience and could hinder the growth of our community.\n\n## The Infrequent Use Case\n\nWhile some of these issues might only affect a small number of users or occur under specific circumstances, it's important to address them to ensure a smooth and enjoyable experience for all users.\n\n## In Core and Done by Us?\n\nYes, these issues are core to the functionality of our game and should be addressed by our team.\n\n## Further Reading\n\n- [V-Sekai](https://v-sekai.org/)\n- This article is assisted by AI.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9c436d47-1e77-44c1-8a52-0fc674673473": {"__data__": {"id_": "9c436d47-1e77-44c1-8a52-0fc674673473", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a1cddd63-cdf8-46d4-8ec4-aeaf2503b9ad", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3b6cf052d4112aa46d1b4a80573fcefdc6fb14828800ebb4276844f488fa299c"}}, "hash": "42749785225ed55779c3781bcb1333ac19887d2c6e928e2e5ea1ebf28f73b6ae", "text": "# To have an alternative CICD use Github Actions.\n\n- Status: proposed <!-- draft | rejected | accepted | deprecated | superseded by -->\n- Deciders: V-Sekai,\n- Tags: V-Sekai,\n\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\nGitHub actions is free and does not require running your own hardware for CI/CD.\nWe understand some users may desire to use this route to build our system.\n\nHowever, we also want our system to be fully self hosted, so as a compromise,\nwe may wish to offer first-party support for both types of continuous integration.\n\n## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nWe will offer github actions files in our official Godot fork as well as our V-Sekai project.\n\n## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\n\nWe will generate github actions templates using the same jsonnet we use for GoCD.\n\n## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- The social network of GitHub is more accessible to most people.\n- Offers more options for building our infrastructure and ways to get into Godot development, which is good.\n- GitHub's donated compute time may free up valuable compute resources for more critical operations.\n\n## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- Maintaining more scripts requires our developer time\n- More codepaths means more QA or pieces that can break.\n\n## Option graveyard:\n\n- Option: Keep the status quo, which is using GoCD or building manually on the command line.\n- Rejection Reason: Building manually on the command line is slow on Windows and not reproducible;\n- Rejection Reason: GoCD is inaccessible to most developers.\n\n## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nIt can.\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nWe want to maintain it to encourage developers and as the publisher of the platform it is our responsibility.\n\n## References <!-- optional and numbers of links can vary -->\n\n- https://jsonnet.org/\n- https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions\n\n## Derivative License\n\nCopyright (c) 2022 V-Sekai contributors.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

It allows for easy sharing and transfer of humanoid 3D models with skeletal animations between different software applications. One such application is the Godot Engine, a popular open-source game engine.\n\n## The Challenge\n\nCurrently, developers working with VRM files in Godot Engine face difficulties when trying to convert these files to Blender format for further editing or manipulation. Manual conversion processes can be time-consuming and error-prone.\n\n## The Strategy\n\nThe proposed strategy for enabling VRM to Blender conversion involves leveraging the computational power of cloud GPUs provided by replicate.com. By running a GPU-accelerated Blender instance, developers can perform an identity operation on the VRM input, converting it to Blender format. This simplifies the process of converting VRM files to Blender format.\n\nTo convert VRM files to Blender format, developers can follow these steps:\n\n1. Install the necessary libraries or plugins in Blender that support the VRM format.\n2. Leverage replicate.com's infrastructure to spin up a GPU-accelerated Blender instance.\n3. Develop a script or tool that takes the VRM file as input and sends it to the GPU-accelerated Blender instance via a REST interface.\n4. In the GPU-accelerated Blender instance, use the installed libraries or plugins to perform the conversion from VRM to Blender format.\n5. Also use Blender to perform the conversion from Blender to VRM/GLTF format.\n\nThis strategy streamlines the workflow for developers, saving time and improving collaboration between designers and developers. The use of cloud GPUs and replicate.com's infrastructure ensures fast and efficient conversion processes.\n\nAdditionally, this strategy can also be extended to other software applications or websites that can utilize a REST interface, allowing developers working with VRM files to convert them to Blender format seamlessly, regardless of the software they are using.\n\n## The Upside\n\n- Streamlined workflow: Developers can easily convert VRM files to Blender format, opening up a wide range of editing and manipulation possibilities.\n- Time-saving: The use of cloud GPUs and replicate.com's infrastructure ensures fast and efficient conversion processes.\n- Improved collaboration: The ability to work with VRM models in both Godot Engine and Blender facilitates collaboration between designers and developers.\n\n## The Downside\n\n- Development effort and expertise: Creating the necessary library or plugin may require significant technical knowledge in both the Godot Engine and VRM format.\n- Compatibility issues: Different versions of FBX or GLB files may introduce compatibility challenges during the conversion process.\n- Maintenance challenges: Keeping up with future updates to the Godot Engine and VRM specifications may require ongoing effort.\n\n## The Road Not Taken\n\nWe considered developing a web application, but it was deemed to have heavy engineering costs.\n\n## The Infrequent Use Case\n\nWhile the proposed solution focuses on streamlining VRM to Blender conversion for the Godot Engine ecosystem, the same concept can be extended to other software applications or websites that can utilize a REST interface. This allows developers working with VRM files to convert them to Blender format seamlessly, regardless of the software they are using. The use of cloud GPUs and replicate.com's infrastructure still ensures fast and efficient conversion processes.\n\n## In Core and Done by Us?\n\nFire knows the way.\n\n## Further Reading\n\n- [V-Sekai](https://v-sekai.org/)\n- [VRM Animation Specification](https://github.com/vrm-c/vrm-specification/tree/master/specification/VRMC_vrm_animation-1.0)\n- [Replicate - Cloud GPU Toy](https://replicate.com/fire/v-sekai.mediapipe-labeler)\n\nThis article is assisted by AI.\n\nIs there anything else I can assist you with?", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "64fa97dd-cbf5-4c4f-9656-6b10ae3a4d15": {"__data__": {"id_": "64fa97dd-cbf5-4c4f-9656-6b10ae3a4d15", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f794712c-c78d-4c14-9ede-03d79cb21d65", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e012b384bc7464d3252f922a10c41ab20ef8fa171c33be744c8db72525162289"}}, "hash": "b7d5754f75d40456dc3fd53d2ed820f1002df10eabb75906f25e80b4fe65cafd", "text": "# Take a streaming godot game and streaming the VRM to OpenSoundControl\n\n### Context and Problem Statement\n\nStreaming to Godot OSC to jsons.\n\n### Describe the feature / enhancement and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nStream the animation player because we have no way to stream Godot as a autonomous program.\n\n### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams\n\n1.

How can we improve the collaboration process and attract more contributors to work on the project more effectively?\n\n### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nThe proposed option to overcome the limitation of attracting more contributors and improving collaboration is to develop clear and concise project documentation, including a visual roadmap using mermaid.js, and establish a transparent contribution process. This will provide a structured environment for new and existing contributors to collaborate and understand the project's goals and priorities.\n\n#### How it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\n- [ ] A well-organized project documentation and visual roadmap will help potential contributors understand the project's scope and vision, allowing them to make informed decisions about contributing.\n- [ ] A transparent contribution process will facilitate collaboration by providing guidelines, resources, and communication channels for contributors.\n- [ ] Onboarding new contributors with tutorials and mentorship will help them quickly become productive and dedicated team members.\n- [ ] Regular meetings and progress updates will keep the team motivated and focused on achieving milestones.\n- [ ] Recognizing and rewarding contributors will foster a sense of community and commitment, making it more likely that they continue contributing to the project.\n\nWith these measures in place, the V-Sekai project will overcome its current limitations, making it easier for the team to work together and attract new contributors.\n\n### Describe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\n\nDevelop a clear and concise project documentation that outlines the project's goals, requirements, and milestones. Establish a transparent and structured contribution process, including:\n\n1. Create a centralized repository for documentation, code, and assets, with clear guidelines for contributing.\n2. Develop a project roadmap with prioritized tasks, deadlines, and assigned responsibilities.\n3. Implement an onboarding process for new contributors, including tutorials, resources, and mentorship.\n4. Organize regular meetings and communication channels for updates, progress reports, and collaboration.\n5. Recognize and reward contributors for their work, fostering a sense of community and commitment.\n\n### Positive Consequences\n\n1. Improved collaboration and communication among the team\n2. Attracting more contributors with diverse skill sets\n3. Faster progress towards project milestones\n4. Clear understanding of project goals and priorities\n\n\n### Negative Consequences\n\n1. Increased management and coordination overhead\n2. Potential for disagreements on priorities and approaches\n\n\n### Option graveyard\n\n1. Relying on informal communication and ad-hoc collaboration\n2. Continuing with the current approach without a structured process\n\n\n### If this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nWhile it may be possible to work around some aspects of the problem with a few lines of script, it would not address the underlying issues of attracting and retaining contributors or improving collaboration.

However, there are certain limitations that hinder the overall user experience. This proposal aims to address these limitations by proposing specific areas for improvement within V-Sekai.\n\n## The Challenge\n\nV-Sekai currently faces several limitations, including non-functional menus in VR mode and a limited number of available worlds. These challenges affect the usability and variety of experiences for the users. To overcome these challenges and enhance the V-Sekai user experience, we must prioritize and focus on one area for improvement.\n\n### Proposed Solutions\n\nWe propose focusing on **Generating More Worlds** as the first step towards enhancing V-Sekai. By creating new VR worlds within V-Sekai, users will have a wider range of experiences to explore. This involves designing and implementing new environments to expand the options available. With more worlds to choose from, users will have increased engagement and longer sessions within the V-Sekai platform.\n\n## The Strategy\n\nTo generate more worlds for V-Sekai, we will follow a comprehensive strategy that includes the following steps:\n\n1. **Identify User Preferences**: Understand the target audience and their preferences. Research popular VR themes, genres, and settings to get an idea of what users would enjoy.\n\n2. **Design New Environments**: Use 3D modeling software like Blender or Unity to design new virtual environments for V-Sekai. Consider creating diverse worlds like fantasy realms, futuristic cities, natural landscapes, or historical settings.\n\n3. **Implement Interactive Elements**: Make the new worlds interactive by adding objects, characters, and elements that users can engage with. This can include non-playable characters (NPCs), puzzles, hidden items, or mini-games within each world.\n\n4. **Test and Refine**: Conduct thorough testing to ensure the new worlds are visually appealing, optimized for performance, and provide a seamless VR experience. Gather user feedback and make necessary improvements based on their suggestions.\n\n5. **Integrate with V-Sekai**: Once the new worlds are ready, integrate them into the V-Sekai platform. Ensure they are easily accessible through the menus or navigation system within V-Sekai's VR interface.\n\n6. **Release and Promote**: Launch the updated version of V-Sekai with the newly generated worlds. Promote the release through various channels, such as social media, gaming forums, Virtual Reality communities, and V-Sekai's official website.\n\nBy following this strategy, we will not only address the current limitations but also create an engaging and immersive VR experience for V-Sekai users.\n\n## Upsides\n\n- Increased user engagement: The availability of more worlds will provide users with greater options to explore, leading to longer sessions and increased immersion in V-Sekai.\n- Expanded user base: With a wider range of experiences, V-Sekai will attract new users who are looking for diverse VR environments.\n- Positive word-of-mouth: Satisfied users will share their experiences with others, generating positive reviews and recommendations for V-Sekai.\n\n## Downsides\n\n- Development complexity: Creating new worlds requires significant effort and resources, including 3D modeling, programming, and testing. This may lead to increased development time and costs.\n- Upfront investment: Generating more worlds will require upfront investment in terms of design, implementation, and integration with V-Sekai.\n- User feedback and iteration: Continuous user feedback is crucial to refine and improve the new worlds. This iterative process may extend the development timeline.\n\n## The Road Not Taken\n\nAn alternative solution that was considered was **Integrating Backend Services**. This would involve improving the backend infrastructure of V-Sekai to enhance scalability, performance, and reliability. However, after careful consideration, we prioritize generating more worlds as it directly addresses user experience limitations and provides tangible benefits in terms of user engagement and appeal.\n\n## In Core and Done by Us?\n\nThe generation of more worlds is within the core capabilities of our team at V-Sekai. We have experienced 3D designers, developers, and testers who are skilled in creating immersive VR environments. Therefore, we are confident in our ability to execute this proposed solution effectively and efficiently.\n\n## Further Reading\n\n- [V-Sekai](https://v-sekai.org/)\n- This article is assisted by AI.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9e5be412-2c91-4c71-9f78-df3f474655ae": {"__data__": {"id_": "9e5be412-2c91-4c71-9f78-df3f474655ae", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ccdb118e-3516-4eea-8292-a039845f3521", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0515f59f9a993964e73cd19793dc3ceb81141b8ee6f6695f0147e171f05a9f48"}, "2": {"node_id": "82141389-17b0-4995-b7d2-ad45858b7a2c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "67c680109452c1cc0e07e8f05023a16608bbfcf706dc98217f86b686de9f2a1d"}}, "hash": "39a67ae16a3d4783495baf3532bf01108a57e13d4e49a40df9c53ba96e290c32", "text": "If you have any further questions or need clarification on any aspect of this proposal, please feel free to ask.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "622f7802-f964-4782-a77e-b12be46a8f1a": {"__data__": {"id_": "622f7802-f964-4782-a77e-b12be46a8f1a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "561d05fb-6aac-4602-b044-7ca78a035daf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a61fe4bd08081637a2eb8e4265129ff2e02b5405e29737b0fcf0b7c597a22f14"}, "3": {"node_id": "c8c07978-4f20-4181-8ce6-802009be5c02", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b29bbe3648bc0fbbed1307af6b98820967b50716ae8c3e78a526e244cb88ef74"}}, "hash": "eadcd4cca82bff634b41ba2682af4c7dea8e98535bd0eebc2a6654e881a6564f", "text": "# Planning V-Sekai on 2022-02-21 Superseded\n\n- Status: superseded <!-- draft | rejected | accepted | deprecated | superseded by -->\n- Deciders: V-Sekai,ifire,lyuma,\n- Tags: V-Sekai,\n\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\nSuperseded - See https://github.com/V-Sekai/V-Sekai/blob/master/decisions/20220224-v-sekai-version-two-plan.md\n\nKnow where we're going by describing what we want.\n\n## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nProposed mission and a list of tasks.\n\n## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\n\n### To further the development of Godot and open source tech\n\n- Godot Engine pull requests.\n\n### To build a tech stack and service for interactive multiplayer VR games.\n\n1.

However, we want to use it as a C++ module, which requires porting from CMake to SCons. This change will also allow us to experiment with soft physics.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n### Steps\n\n1. Analyze the current structure of Godot Jolt as a GDExtension.\n2. Plan the new structure as a C++ module.\n3. Convert the build system from CMake to SCons.\n4. Test the newly created C++ module in different scenarios.\n5. Experiment with soft physics once the module is stable.\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe implementation details will be decided upon acceptance of this proposal.\n\n## Positive Consequences\n\n- More control over the engine's core functionality.\n- Ability to experiment with soft physics.\n- Better integration with Godot's core systems.\n- Enable double precision support\n\n## Negative Consequences\n\n- Requires knowledge of both CMake and SCons.\n- Potential increase in development time due to the complexity of porting.\n\n## Option Graveyard\n\nThis section will be filled as we explore different options and discard those that are not feasible or effective.\n\n## If this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nGiven the complexity of porting a GDExtension to a C++ module, it cannot be simply worked around with a few lines of script.\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nPorting Godot Jolt to a C++ module will provide more flexibility and control over its functionalities. It aligns with our goal of enhancing the capabilities of our game engine.\n\n## References\n\n- [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/)\n- [SCons](https://scons.org/)\n- [CMake](https://cmake.org/)", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f916a6f4-f356-49c6-9afc-6dd96cc8b6b7": {"__data__": {"id_": "f916a6f4-f356-49c6-9afc-6dd96cc8b6b7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "00e1209c-5bd6-4a41-a298-a6409370450c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b44898d0b094b570dcfc62cb62c3c825aeafe1a50896148b88dd056e1d095daf"}}, "hash": "7b731e14822e9cbe040cd32b2c12ad27ba857f1ff0105b3a736ec32340500a3f", "text": "# Add WMF for windows media playback\n\n### Context and Problem Statement\n\nWe don't have any good ways of playing video and also large 4k videos.\n\n### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nAdd WMF support to godot for the windows platform.\n\n### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\n\nSee https://github.com/V-Sekai/godot/tree/wmf\n\n### Positive Consequences\n\nCan play videos.\n\nOS platform supported playback will be hardware accelerated.\n\n### Negative Consequences\n\n_No response_\n\n### Option graveyard\n\n_No response_\n\n### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nIt's not a few lines.\n\n### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nI found this!\n\n### References\n\n- [V-Sekai](https://v-sekai.org/)\n\n### License of the contribution\n\nCopyright (c) 2022 V-Sekai contributors.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Why build incomplete Gltf extensions with limited usefulness without the complete package? We should be making for creators, not ourselves.\n\n## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\n`humbletim`, `codefloof`, `iFire` and `lyuma` debated the meaningfulness of building Gltf extensions.\n\niFire constructed an argument we are making a Gltf container for the metaverse. A metaverse container where each part is separated because of limited engineering bandwidth. We brought up the point Gltf isn't unknown and is unknown.\n\nLyuma can't entirely agree that Gltf extensions are \"separated.\" Gltf extensions are independent extensions that are good from an engineering perspective.\n\nLyuma reaffirmed his suspicions that OMI standards are not so valuable in isolation. Humbletim raised valid concerns that the Unity work had not progressed, and Mozilla Hubs had not merged the OMI audio emitter code. We may need Unity platforms and Mozilla Hubs to bootstrap the ecosystem, but tools like Gltf transform could sidestep it.\n\niFire also constructed a strawman of how operating inside a platform is seamless, and transferring between platforms is like pulling teeth. Still, a strawman isn't something that helped facilitate the discussion so Lyuma may have misunderstood that part. iFire described the unity package vs others. Lyuma agrees that this is valid; other formats could be deemed \"interoperable,\" more expressive than Gltf.\n\nIn Lyuma's mind, it's a fair X point that already exists. So why work on Y? Why does Gltf 3d format if we have Fbx 3d format etc.?\n\nLyuma doesn't think we need to assume that there must be only one standard.\n\nWe're trying to see if we can do better by working together than taking some existing closed format and using it verbatim.\n\nOMI work is valid even if a unity package standard exists. We don't need to be the only standard.\n\niFire didn't exhaust all the details of the point, but we can make a Gltf transform for as many standards we can catalogue.\n\n## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\n\nWe will generate github actions templates using the same jsonnet we use for GoCD.\n\n## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- Interoperating between platforms.\n\n## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- Easy to ignore users.\n\n## Option graveyard:\n\n- Option: Keep the status quo, which is having separate platforms.\n- Rejection Reason: We want interoperability at OMI.\n\n## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nIt is not only a few lines of code.\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nWe want to maintain it to encourage developers and as the publisher of the platform it is our responsibility.\n\n## References <!-- optional and numbers of links can vary -->\n\n- https://omigroup.org/\n\n## Derivative License\n\nCopyright (c) 2022 V-Sekai contributors.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

We want an expanded AnimationTree to customize nodes, mainly when Godot Engine adds procedural animation features.\n\nSaracen wants to make sure that the AnimationTree gets the features needed so any custom nodes can be quickly prototyped via scripted extensions if needed. Doing it in purely c++ can limit scripting.\n\niFire's \"hard coding\" definition tests if the node is different from writing the node from a composition of existing nodes. A VMD animation tree node would be \"hard coding.\"\n\nThere are currently some limitations with the AnimationTree, which makes the animation tree somewhat challenging to extend with custom nodes via scripting. However, the good news is, we do not think it would take much to make a VMD AnimationTree node work.

In particular, the dynamic_shapes and simple_embedding samples showcase how to run on your choice of target. The input program may have a signature in the stablehlo dialect, and you can use IREE or XLA depending on your preferred tech stack or runtime requirements. The Vulkan stack in IREE is relatively stable and offers good performance, with nod.ai's SHARK offering extra tuning and APIs on top.

Modify the editor export process to stream MVSQLite to the Godot Engine server.\n2. Schedule externally consistent syncing of MVSQLite with the Godot Engine server (1 frame).\n3. Schedule periodic syncing of MVSQLite to a backup (e.g., every 30 minutes).\n\n## Implementation\n\n```gdscript\n# Step 1: Insert MVSQLite data directly into the MVSQLite database.\nfunc insert_data_to_database():\n    var mvsqlite_data = get_mvsqlite_data()\n    var db = MVSQLite.new()\n    db.open(\"user://your_database_name.db\")\n    for data in mvsqlite_data:\n        db.execute(\"INSERT INTO your_table_name (column1, column2) VALUES (?, ?)\", [data.column1, data.column2])\n    db.close()\n\n# Step 2: Schedule externally consistent syncing of MVSQLite with the SQLite database (1 frame).\nfunc _process(delta):\n    if should_sync():\n        insert_data_to_database()\n\n# Step 3: Schedule periodic syncing of MVSQLite to a backup (e.g., every 30 minutes).\nvar backup_timer = Timer.new()\nfunc _ready():\n    backup_timer.set_wait_time(1800) # 30 minutes in seconds\n    backup_timer.connect(\"timeout\", self, \"_on_backup_timer_timeout\")\n    add_child(backup_timer)\n    backup_timer.start()\n\nfunc _on_backup_timer_timeout():\n    insert_data_to_database()\n\n# Helper functions\nfunc get_mvsqlite_data():\n    # Placeholder for obtaining MVSQLite data from the project\n    pass\n\nfunc should_sync():\n    # Placeholder for determining when to sync MVSQLite data with the SQLite database\n    pass\n```\n\n## Positive Consequences\n\n- Improved data management and performance.\n- Enhanced security through server validation and sanitization.\n- Reduced load on the client-side.\n\n## Negative Consequences\n\n- Increased complexity in the system architecture.\n- Potential challenges in implementing the new architecture.\n\n## Option Graveyard\n\n1. **Client-side caching**: Storing data on the client-side to reduce server load. However, this approach can lead to security vulnerabilities and inconsistent data across clients.\n2. **Static file export**: Exporting data as static files instead of using MVSQLite. This option was rejected due to limited flexibility and scalability.\n\nThese options were considered but ultimately rejected in favor of the proposed solution, which aims to balance performance, security, and maintainability.\n\n## If this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nThe proposed enhancement is designed to address core limitations in V-Sekai's architecture and cannot be easily worked around with a few lines of script.\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nImplementing this solution at the core level ensures that all users benefit from improved data management, performance, and security. Additionally, addressing these limitations at the core level allows for better integration with other components of the system.\n\n## References\n\n- [V-Sekai](https://v-sekai.org/)", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d5d23c47-4ce4-4fe3-841c-765bc9e46af2": {"__data__": {"id_": "d5d23c47-4ce4-4fe3-841c-765bc9e46af2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bdd98680-8cbb-474f-9148-83a462c90176", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c1946f4cece9c322c3ad1c975385b477c59d4ff7f6a46f4cb0abbdddd1ee5214"}}, "hash": "d4285ee04da8fbe3833fb3ac9757e40b00967bd94656b1f89ebce6eda400df59", "text": "# View the worlds and interact with people in VR without being in VR via a Discord Inward Portal\n\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\nI want to see the worlds and interact with people in VR, without being in VR myself.\n\n## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nA Discord voice/video call bot would allow players within the virtual world and outside to interact with each other.\n\n## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\n\nThis would be a bot client that connects to at least one server shard, and joins a Discord voice call, using WebRTC APIs to communicate voice and video data from Godot into discord.\n\n## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- Growing engagement with Groups\n\n## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- Requires Discord\n\n## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nPlayers can stream using OBS or discord screen sharing, but this requires players to do it, and only provides uni-directional communication.\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nIt should be a standalone project based on Groups, but not core.

The objective is to deliver uninterrupted gameplay and a comprehensive gaming experience.\n\n## Challenges\n\nKey challenges encompass managing single shard overload, administering shadow shards, and implementing state synchronization and game state transitions. These tasks necessitate precise planning, execution, and monitoring for peak performance.\n\n## Approach\n\nA simple gameplay session will be initiated where an art sourcer can upload artwork. The game environment will be a flat surface with a boundary, allowing for mathematical movement calculations without a navigation mesh.\n\nThe number of clients connecting to the server will be gradually increased, starting small and eventually reaching 2000. This will test the server's capacity to handle multiple connections. During testing, system resources will be monitored to estimate the cost and resources required to support 2000 players. Gameplay sessions will be recorded for the trade show and load testing will be conducted to ensure our server can manage the maximum number of players without crashing or significant slowdowns.\n\n1. **Server Configuration**: Set up a Godot server that listens on a designated port.\n2. **Client Development**: Build a Godot client that connects to our server using High-Level Networking.\n3. **Shadow Shard Administration**: Generate shadow copies of the original shard, serialize them for network transmission, and synchronize their state periodically.\n4. **State Synchronization**: Develop `Ref<Animation>` data structures symbolizing different parts of the model and outline their interactions.\n5. **Game State Transitions**: Preserve the current game state, pinpoint the target state, transition to it, and validate the transition using an orphan `AnimationTree`.\n\n## Advantages\n\nThis strategy allows us to accommodate numerous clients simultaneously without sacrificing performance or user experience. It also provides a systematic method to monitor and enhance gaming sessions.\n\n## Limitations\n\nThis approach requires substantial resources and expertise in server configuration, networking, and game development. Unexpected challenges may surface during implementation and testing.\n\n## Alternatives\n\nA potential alternative could have been adopting a different game engine or networking model. However, this would demand a complete revamp of our existing setup, possibly compromising performance and flexibility.\n\n## Exceptional Scenarios\n\nIn situations of unexpected traffic surges or server outages, contingency plans are essential to minimize gameplay disruption.\n\n## Responsibility\n\nAll tasks outlined are integral to our operations and will be undertaken by us.\n\n## Additional Resources\n\n- [V-Sekai](https://v-sekai.org/)\n- This article is assisted by AI.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a7635f26-6681-46c9-9ef7-4f3c5fc4f84b": {"__data__": {"id_": "a7635f26-6681-46c9-9ef7-4f3c5fc4f84b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "42fa75a6-b99e-4f7f-9196-297c0a4ec8de", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e568baec83abf81dba27b0d2d448d895a69e46d478c4ea21c5e86105c0326771"}}, "hash": "861dd5458577e0e2e3cafa68d6f02fa36532d34e4c1f76c42a6b517b7c1862ef", "text": "# OIT in Godot Engine\n\n### Context and Problem Statement\n\nRender hair well.\n\n### Describe the feature / enhancement and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nUse \"Shortcut\" or \"PPLL\" to render OIT transparency.\n\n### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams\n\n> Shortcut takes 4 passes but is faster.\n\nTressFX technology uses order independent transparency.\n\n> (OIT).

This has led to issues when trying to move parts of the skeleton such as the head or legs towards the torso.\n\n## The Challenge\n\nThe challenge lies in implementing these constraints without causing other issues within the system. Some bones are not solved and should not be constrained, adding complexity to the task.\n\n## The Strategy\n\nThe strategy is to carefully analyze each bone and determine the appropriate constraints. This will involve a combination of swing rotation and twist rotation constraints, depending on the specific bone.\n\n## The Upside\n\nBy implementing these constraints, we can improve the functionality and reliability of the Godot humanoid skeleton system. This will allow for more realistic movements and prevent system errors when moving certain parts of the skeleton.\n\n## The Downside\n\nThere may be potential challenges in implementing these constraints, particularly for the unsolved bones. It will require careful testing and adjustment to ensure that the new constraints do not introduce new issues.\n\n## The Road Not Taken\n\nAn alternative would be to leave the system as it is, accepting its limitations. However, this would mean missing out on the potential improvements that could be achieved through this proposal.\n\n## The Infrequent Use Case\n\nIn some rare cases, the lack of constraints might actually be beneficial, allowing for unusual or exaggerated movements. These cases will need to be considered and potentially addressed separately.\n\n## In Core and Done by Us?\n\nYes, this change would be implemented in the core system by the V-Sekai team.\n\n## Further Reading\n\n- [V-Sekai](https://v-sekai.org/)\n- This article is assisted by AI.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "31e580f0-7f75-4da0-ba39-e5be50b3e684": {"__data__": {"id_": "31e580f0-7f75-4da0-ba39-e5be50b3e684", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "17123966-b688-414e-8d5e-d39c70f6ae5d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f91f1ee4dc25f7c844ab5ea906ad994a9bdc6ea27d7e7434a3787227ac08035d"}}, "hash": "fa12c78dfd275ae40b4223ad7c693175fc8ea57d23050bd6a1c17393db759f4a", "text": "# To provide an asset library prototype use baserow\n\n### Describe the status of the issue.\n\ndraft\n\n### List the deciders of the issue.\n\nV-Sekai,fire,\n\n### Describe the tags of the issue.\n\nV-Sekai,\n\n### Context and Problem Statement\n\nWant to prototype a game asset library system.\n\n### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nNeed a sandbox to prototype asset library.\n\n### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\n\n1. install truenas on two redundant data drives and on a os drive\n1. install baserow.io as a docker compose\n1. add vrm three.js viewer to baserow for .gltf and .vrm\n\n### Positive Consequences\n\nAble to lean prototype asset libraries.\n\n### Negative Consequences\n\n_No response_\n\n### Option graveyard\n\n_No response_\n\n### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nNot a few lines of script.\n\n### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nWanted to lean prototype.\n\n### References\n\n- [V-Sekai](https://v-sekai.org/)\n\n### License of the contribution\n\nCopyright (c) 2022 V-Sekai contributors.

This can be a hindrance for users who want to have more control over the appearance of their avatars. To address this, we propose an enhancement that introduces various tools and techniques to overcome these limitations and provide a more comprehensive avatar creation process.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nHere is a list of raw processes to be broken down.\n\n### To create a source, filter, sink pipeline system for this project, we can use the following mime labels:\n\n1. Source: The source will provide the initial avatar model and any additional assets required. The input mime type for the source could be `application/gltf+json` or `model/gltf+json` if the avatar is in GLTF format, or `image/png` or `image/svg+xml` if the avatar is provided as a 2D image.\n\n2. Filter: The filter will handle all the customization steps mentioned above. It will take the input from the source and apply the necessary modifications to create the desired avatar. The input mime type for the filter would be the same as the output mime type of the source, depending on whether the avatar is in GLTF format or represented as an image.\n\n3. Sink: The sink will receive the customized avatar from the filter and store it as the final output. For this project, the sink should support both PNG and SVG images for 2D avatars, and GLTF for 3D avatars. Therefore, the output mime types for the sink would be `image/png` or `image/svg+xml` for 2D avatars, and `application/gltf+json` or `model/gltf+json` for 3D avatars.\n\nNote: To avoid lossy formats, we are using PNG or SVG for 2D images and GLTF for 3D formats. PNG and SVG are lossless image formats, while GLTF is a lossless 3D format that preserves the fidelity of the avatar model.\n\n### Advanced Customization Steps:\n\nHere are the converted inputs and outputs in the xstate format for each step:\n\n1. **Importing the avatar into Godot Engine and \"Project Mirage\":**\n   - Input: `.vrm` file\n   - Output: `.vrm` file\n\n2. **Refining the imported avatar:**\n   - Input: `.vrm` file\n   - Output: `.vrm` file\n\n3. **Converting spring bone to physical simulation bones and colliders:**\n   - Input: `.vrm` file\n   - Output: assetpackage file\n\n4. **Addressing painting errors:**\n   - Input: `.vrm` file\n   - Output: `.vrm` file\n\n5. **Choosing a material:**\n   - Input: `.vrm` file\n   - Output: `.vrm` file\n\n6. **Resolving issues with materials and bones:**\n   - Input: `.vrm` file\n   - Output: `.vrm` file\n\n7. **Correcting colors and addressing pleated folds:**\n   - Input: `.vrm` file\n   - Output: `.vrm` file\n\n8. **Creating complex geometric structures:**\n   - Input: `.vrm` file\n   - Output: `.vrm` file\n\n10. **Utilizing Vroid Hub's hair painter and mesh generator:**\n   - Input: `.vrm` file\n   - Output: `.vrm` enhanced data\n\n11. **Adding facial expressions for motion capture:**\n   - Input: `.vrm` file\n   - Output: `.gltf` motion capture data\n\n12. **Setting up motion capture:**\n   - Input: `.vrm` file\n   - Output: vrm animations data stored as `.gltf`.\n\n## Positive Consequences\n\n- Users will be able to create highly customizable avatars with specific features.\n- The avatar creation process will be enhanced with a variety of tools and techniques.\n- Detailed customization of colors, clothing, accessories, and facial expressions will be possible.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ff766e72-be6b-41a3-a7a0-2920c086026f": {"__data__": {"id_": "ff766e72-be6b-41a3-a7a0-2920c086026f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7cd79ee2-233e-418a-8078-092d50465da1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "dcc132f27789c4c11434d007dcb91a4a9be836fd18a97a2c364dd19787f5e71f"}, "2": {"node_id": "64d55e47-b40c-4c04-8ce5-be7330116dfe", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "dad9bc8e304c9f12c3956a2d56d326542734c335d4519b673013c378c6649bec"}}, "hash": "b80313475074ff3c029e53692ccc5e0e04b1d0473994d3d3c60166f9e028b652", "text": "- Detailed customization of colors, clothing, accessories, and facial expressions will be possible.\n- Motion capture capabilities can be integrated for more realistic animations.\n\n## Negative Consequences\n\n- The implementation process is complex and may require advanced technical skills from users.\n- Some steps, like creating a 3D model of the back of the avatar, may not always be successful.\n- Painting errors and other imperfections may remain in the final avatar.\n\n## Option graveyard\n\n- Excessive complexity or technical requirements: We want the avatar creation process to be user-friendly and accessible to a wide range of users, so any options that require advanced technical skills or have excessively complex customization controls will not be included.\n\n## If this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nNo, the proposed enhancement involves a multi-step process that cannot be easily replicated with just a few lines of script.\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nThe proposed enhancement addresses the limitations in V-Sekai's avatar creation process, providing users with a comprehensive solution for creating highly customizable avatars.

To propose something you have to have a fleshed out proposal.\n\nThat works well for Godot for two reasons: Godot has lots of users so there are already too many feature proposals; and the users of Godot are developers who can be asked to do research and write a whole implementation proposal\n\nThe users of V-Sekai are not technical in the same way; and furthermore we are not at the scale Godot was in 3.2 when they switched to requiring proposals.\n\nIf we ever do get big enough that feature requests propose a burden then we can consider making it harder to file them\n\n## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nModify the V-Sekai-game issue templates to be easier to use.\n\n## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\n\nRemove required fields.

Aside from the Entity script being attached to the root node of a scene(?), and the scene itself being a node. Additionally, it may be necessary to query a node to find its containing entity (parent node).\nNote: Interaction between nodes _within_ a single entity is considered an implementation detail of that entity and is out of the scope of the entity system. Any security model assumes that nodes cannot be transferred, shared or reparented between entities.\n\nEntities are objects known to the server and with explicit handling for state synchronization.\n\nSome entities may choose to synchronize little state, or position only, or no state at all.\nAlso, some entities may choose to provide no security or isolation, while others may be private and appear not to even exist to other nodes. For example, a local player menu built upon the Entity System's interaction features, gaining features A, D, F and G.\nBy building this common framework, it means that systems built as Entities can be trivially synchronized over the network.\n\n## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams\n\n**Todo**: We may want a way to optimistically spawn an entity client-side to achieve maximal responsiveness and fun.\n\nHowever, these entities will not yet know their server-side entity ID. Proposals: Reserve portion of ID space; or locally hold onto events/state and flush once the ID is known.\n\n### A. Spawning\n\nThere will be a global directory of spawnable objects as part of a server connection.\nPlayers and maps can reference scenes by some name to spawn an entity with that name.\n\n### B. Consistent References\n\nEntities will have a server-assigned ID.\n**Todo**: What to do if an entity is spawned locally and an ID is not yet known.\n\n### C. State Synchronization\n\nEntities will define a set of state variables that must be synced.\nThe network protocol will take care of updating the state gradually over time, as well as rate-limiting.\nEvents can be used to provide forced updates.\nGuarantees? Exposing metadata about when the state was updated?\n\n**Entity properties:**\n\n- State that is synced is properties.\n- Some properties are only assignable at spawn time (for example, scene file?)\n- Some properties such as transform may require special handling.\n\nUpdate intervals:\n\nEntity refreshing / full state synchronization & serialization:\n\nDelta encoding & ACK protocol:\n\nWhen to use reliable events vs. \"unreliable\" (eventual) state synchronization: Events as a means for state synchronization.\n\n### D. Standard Interaction Protocols\n\nTODO: What classes / bespoke types exist?\nExamples: Physics, Physics Pickup; Button; Movable Platform; Vehicle\n\n### E. Network Security Model:\n\n**Concepts:**\n\n**Ownership:**\n\nAll entities will be owned by the player who interacts with them or by the server.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1b358509-d788-473d-a8c9-beb2867b69e4": {"__data__": {"id_": "1b358509-d788-473d-a8c9-beb2867b69e4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "60a3a957-744c-4d93-9581-3d98bea0c405", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "cf8d2cf31e086801ff557d5c42d586d2414198b372f3762bcd01923189b95314"}, "2": {"node_id": "c8c5d770-b912-45f0-b25c-7466594160db", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "4c9b8a9af488c38ab20de27f66c18780e7ca4c7e6f76d1b1b5ed29f8bdd651a9"}, "3": {"node_id": "cd304a37-44a3-431c-b5bd-b20b2b4a7dcf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0b8f164eb58d1f32a9f1f5c44f0cf966c53f161e23255f268fee7c82e6b5495d"}}, "hash": "6f57ff02b07ec6f8c37dbed8805a22ea5260172c8ac16f773e9fb235dc9248e3", "text": "Entity ownership will be transferred if the current owner leaves.\n\n**Mastership:**\n\nMap entities may largely be mastered by a dedicated server.\n\nAvatar entities and props will be mastered by the player that spawned them, even if another player owns them.\n\n(Example: Alice personally spawns a ball avatar prop and throws it to Bob, who catches it. Alice has Mastership; Bob has Ownership.)  \nMastership may be transferred on map exit; or they may be despawned (the player \"takes\" their props with them.)\n\nPrivacy: Entities may reveal very little state to the network. Are there cases where different players may be given different permissions?\n\nExample: Cooperative game, in which state is shared between some players but not others.\n\nExample: Team Melee\n\n### F. Inter-entity Isolation\n\nScript-level guarantees that information about other entities is either restricted or absent entirely.  \nIt may require a custom scripting language to achieve these guarantees fully.\n\n### G. Abstraction\n\nNot much to say here. We should see as little as possible built on top of pure Godot Nodes, except as a means for providing the entity's functions.\n\n### H. Physics\n\nEntities will not be allowed to contain physics objects within the node hierarchy. Instead, physics objects must be _attached_ to the entity in specific ways.  \nQuestions: how does this work with PhysicalBone; how are physics objects linked to the entity; what about animations? (scale, rotation, skeleton attachments driving physical bodies?)\n\n### Spawn Type (i). Map builtins\n\nMaps will have entities that might not be spawnable but will be automatically created and referenced within the parent scene.  \nFor example, a button/door; or a state \"god object\"; or physics objects; built-in TV screens.\n\n### Spawn Type (ii). Map spawns\n\nMaps will provide a directory of map-spawnable scene references, which can be instantiated in response to events.  \nThese will usually have specific functions within a particular map.  \nExamples: Game-specific weapons; Keys; Buildings constructed\n\n### Spawn Type (iii). Avatar spawns\n\nPlayers may also provide a directory of avatar-spawnable scenes; Additionally, a prop database may exist or be negotiated.  \nThese may include local UIs; weapons, pencils; media players; pets (parrots, mounts); vehicles; flight mechanics (wings?); visual effects.\n\n### Notes about Entity parenting:\n\nNodePath references (../) out of an entity hierarchy must be disallowed.\nParenting should be implemented carefully: If nodes are literally parented to another entity (e.g. vehicles), NodePath references could expose implementation details from one entity to another entity.\n\nPart of a solution to this is to provide Attachment points as a feature of an Entity, but this needs to be implemented carefully to prevent unusual situations, for example, parent entity/node is destroyed (`queue_free()`) or removed from the scene tree (`remove_child()`); or animation paths referencing a node of the child entity.\n\n## Positive Consequences List <!-- optional -->\n\n- Possibility of:\n  - vehicle games\n  - bow and arrow games\n  - pickup of balls\n\n## Negative Consequences List <!-- optional -->\n\n- Complexity\n\n## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nA networking system is not a few lines of code.\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nYes, this is the foundation of the protocol and the basic set of nodes and behavior upon which content will be created.\n\n## References <!-- optional -->\n\nAldridge, David. \"I Shot You First: networking the Gameplay of Halo: Reach\".

However, it has some limitations that need to be addressed to improve its performance and user experience.\n\n## The Challenge\n\nThe main challenge is to update the V-Sekai game engine to enhance its features and fix existing issues.\n\n## The Strategy\n\nHere are the steps we propose to take:\n\n1. Update the Godot Engine fork with git assembler.\n2. Release the fork to the godot engine branch.\n3. Update the V-Sekai-game engine commit hash.\n4. Check the built V-Sekai-game binaries on Github.\n\n## The Upside\n\nUpdating the game engine will provide better performance, improved features, and a more enjoyable user experience.\n\n## The Downside\n\nThe downside could be potential bugs or issues that might arise during the update process.

It's currently facing challenges because there isn't a test game available. The goal is to develop a minimal viable product for a train station simulator. This simulator will focus on avatar rendering, networking simulation, and parented objects in the train.\n\n## The Challenge\n\nThe main problems are the need for precise controls in VR and the ability to render and network large groups of people in VR. This also includes extensive NPC tests with skeletal animation in the Godot engine for VR.\n\n## The Strategy\n\nThe strategy involves adding new features to V-Sekai to address these challenges:\n\n1. **Networking Avatar Crowds:** The aim here is to develop efficient methods for networking large groups of avatars in VR. This will involve creating a system that can handle the high data traffic required for real-time interaction between numerous avatars, while maintaining performance and stability. This could be achieved by implementing advanced networking protocols and optimization techniques to ensure smooth communication between avatars without overloading the network.\n\n## The Upside\n\nIf this strategy is implemented successfully, it could enhance the user experience in VR games developed using the Godot engine. It could also enable the creation of more diverse and complex VR environments.\n\n## The Downside\n\nThis process may require significant resources and time, and there might be technical limitations.\n\n## The Road Not Taken\n\nAn alternative could have been to use a different game engine that already supports these features. However, this wouldn't contribute to the improvement of the Godot engine.\n\n## The Infrequent Use Case\n\nThese improvements might not benefit all types of games or developers. Their relevance depends on the specific needs and goals of each project.\n\n## In Core and Done by Us?\n\nV-Sekai's expertise in VR development and understanding of its challenges make it well-suited to lead these improvements. By doing so, V-Sekai can align with developer needs, contribute to the open-source Godot engine, and help build a stronger community around it.\n\nDespite requiring effort and resources, the potential benefits for both V-Sekai and the wider Godot engine community make it a worthwhile investment.\n\n## Further Reading\n\n- [V-Sekai](https://v-sekai.org/)\n- [Godot Engine Proposal Discussion](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/discussions/4233)\n\nThis article is assisted by AI.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1db4c608-5bd0-4810-8006-a92f34d4629f": {"__data__": {"id_": "1db4c608-5bd0-4810-8006-a92f34d4629f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "125f1388-b2d4-421d-ba16-79e82cc24542", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f3ad9d651b4ee0140c86e0ecfd897588628de7a4ae29886ab1c5791ce93aff1c"}}, "hash": "39a7139c49f5590a2624980562eb47b6ce0b9a92fd14e775f64d2316e2c6a675", "text": "# Allow cicd to pass by fixing spatial audio branch\n\n- Status: accepted <!-- draft | rejected | accepted | deprecated | superseded by -->\n- Deciders: V-Sekai,\n- Tags: V-Sekai,\n\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\nCICD not passing causes quality to degrade.\n\n## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nFix spatial audio branch of godot engine.\n\n## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\n\n1.

Fire shared that they have three modes in mind: blob pen, 2D beautifications for 3D, and patch mode. However, these are not functioning correctly yet due to complexity.\n\n## Decision Outcome\n\nFire will think up some UI for xr-grid, create a simple UI system based on GUI in VR, and add it to xr-grid. We also discuss the possibility of adding a glTF export menu and other features to the UI.\n\n## Positive Consequences\n\nThe team is considering various improvements such as fixing grid bugs, exporting loadable content in Blender, adding branding/instructions, and improving the UI.\n\n## Negative Consequences\n\nThe main challenge is to avoid bloating the main project with art tools. This might require branching or forking the project.\n\n## Prospects for the Future\n\nDETOX suggested creating a branch for the new features, while Fire expressed a desire to work on networking. They also discussed the possibility of building a tool similar to Cassie on the branch.\n\n## Links\n\n- [V-Sekai](https://v-sekai.org/)\n- This article is assisted by AI.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "169e4a45-18ca-4ce6-9e7a-019f61dd879a": {"__data__": {"id_": "169e4a45-18ca-4ce6-9e7a-019f61dd879a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "902706b2-6f2a-4ac8-9798-3330b7c52c59", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c212b1deb48057ac70fdb33c2c5742e99a760bb726ba8dfef9e5a5e2be09930e"}}, "hash": "922959002339932cb0e9a50684fef2bed84f40155cbd241fa8d71c68c29aab16", "text": "# Increase variety and quality with generated animation trees\n\n## Metadata\n\n- Status: proposed\n- Deciders: V-Sekai\n- Tags: V-Sekai, ai assisted\n\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\nGenerate an AnimationTrees with blend trees and nested state machines as a startchart json.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nCreate a script that generates a JSON file representing the AnimationTrees structure, including blend trees and nested state machines.

However, finding specific pieces of code or resources within a large project can be challenging. This is where an embedding search engine like SeaGOAT can come in handy.\n\n## The Challenge\n\nThe challenge lies in integrating the SeaGOAT search engine with Godot Engine projects. Specifically, we need to ensure that it can effectively index and search `.tscn`, `.tres`, `.gd`, `.cpp`, `.h`, and `.xml` files, which are commonly used in Godot projects.\n\n## The Strategy\n\nTo use SeaGOAT with Godot Engine projects, you'll need to add support for `.tscn`, `.tres`, `.gd`, `.cpp`, `.h`, and `.xml` files. You can do this by modifying the `common.py` file in the SeaGOAT repository. Specifically, you'll want to add these extensions to the `FILE_EXTENSIONS` list:\n\n```python\nFILE_EXTENSIONS = [\n    # existing extensions...\n    \".tscn\",\n    \".tres\",\n    \".gd\",\n    \".cpp\",\n    \".h\",\n    \".xml\"\n]\n```\n\nOnce you've done this, SeaGOAT should be able to index and search your Godot Engine projects.\n\n## The Upside\n\nBy integrating SeaGOAT with your Godot Engine projects, you'll be able to quickly and easily find specific pieces of code or resources. This can greatly speed up your development process and make it easier to manage large projects.\n\n## The Downside\n\nThe downside is that this requires modifying the SeaGOAT source code, which may not be ideal if you're not comfortable with Python or if you want to keep your SeaGOAT installation up-to-date with the official repository.\n\n## The Road Not Taken\n\nAn alternative approach would be to use a different search engine that already supports `.tscn`, `.tres`, `.gd`, `.cpp`, `.h`, and `.xml` files. However, this may not provide the same level of functionality as SeaGOAT.\n\n## The Infrequent Use Case\n\nThis strategy is most useful for large Godot Engine projects where finding specific pieces of code or resources can be challenging. For smaller projects, the built-in search functionality in Godot may be sufficient.\n\n## In Core and Done by Us?\n\nThis modification would need to be done by us, as it involves changing the SeaGOAT source code. It's not clear whether this change would be accepted into the core SeaGOAT project.\n\n## Further Reading\n\n- [V-Sekai](https://v-sekai.org/)\n- [SeaGOAT](https://github.com/kantord/SeaGOAT)\n- This article is assisted by AI.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d84147ee-032a-4e4f-b572-e3044dcca7a9": {"__data__": {"id_": "d84147ee-032a-4e4f-b572-e3044dcca7a9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "155f1b28-7b05-47d9-aafa-20b44070f17f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e0ff0d3bc678a8a3109274907b3bc1b2efc1530c163ccbb41e642f53c58e50b7"}}, "hash": "e0ff0d3bc678a8a3109274907b3bc1b2efc1530c163ccbb41e642f53c58e50b7", "text": "# Adopt best practices for product development\n\n### Metadata\n\n- Status: proposed <!-- draft | proposed | rejected | accepted | deprecated | superseded by -->\n- Deciders: V-Sekai,\n- Tags: V-Sekai,\n\n\n### Context and Problem Statement\n\nWe should adopt best practices in developing products.\n\n### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nToyota has a system that was designed with decades of best practices.\n\n### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\n\n1.

Living Design Standards \n\nThe six mechanisms that make up the quality control system are mentoring supervision, chief engineers, cross-functional communication, working instructions and standards.\n\nMentoring supervision serves mainly to build functional expertise, but it also teaches young engineers how to write and interpret reports, work with chief engineers, and understand and use standards. The chief engineer's prestige reinforces the importance of expertise while it also balances out the functional bent of the other engineers. The chief engineer also promotes mutual adjustment by providing the working instructions for each vehicle program and by resolving cross-functional disagreements.\n\nThe second mechanism is cross-functional communication.

Do not implement AnimationTree for this proposal.\n\n## Positive Consequences\n\n- Portable humanoid avatars can be easily created and used in Godot Engine projects.\n- The addition of MToon1 material support provides a physically-based rendering approach for anime-style graphics.\n- Facial expressions, eye tracking, and lip syncing enhance the immersive experience for users.\n- Export functionality allows for easy sharing of avatars between projects and with other users.\n- The use of the VRM spec's suggested algorithm for implementing first-person view simplifies the implementation process.\n\n## Negative Consequences\n\n- The implementation of these features may require additional development time and resources.\n- The addition of new features may increase the complexity of the codebase and require additional maintenance.\n- The use of the MToon1 material may require additional GPU resources and may not be suitable for low-end hardware.\n- The implementation of facial expressions, eye tracking, and lip syncing may require additional hardware or software support.\n\n## Option graveyard\n\nWe are not implementing support for other material types beyond MToon0, MToon1 and gltf PBR, which could limit the range of visual styles that can be achieved with Godot Engine.\n\n## If this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nIt is unlikely that these enhancements can be easily worked around with a few lines of script, as they require significant development effort and integration with the Godot Engine codebase.\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\n- Portable humanoid avatars are a key feature for many Godot Engine projects, and the ability to easily create and use them is important for the success of the engine.\n- The addition of MToon1 material support and other enhancements will improve the quality and visual fidelity of Godot Engine projects.\n- By implementing these features in-house, we can ensure that they are well-integrated with the Godot Engine codebase and meet our quality standards.\n\n## References\n\n- [V-Sekai](https://v-sekai.org/)\n- https://github.com/vrm-c/vrm-specification\n- https://github.com/vrm-c/vrm-specification/blob/master/specification/VRMC_vrm-1.0/firstPerson.md#meshannotationauto-algorithm", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fb5d80ab-0bbd-4f3e-993d-feddff85bd53": {"__data__": {"id_": "fb5d80ab-0bbd-4f3e-993d-feddff85bd53", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "637747e6-b508-4a90-9c6e-282b00e3d182", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "36fcac779151f9f3c964ce946375322000c7794ae35dc50d7fbbe1396fb397e1"}}, "hash": "bc67f746c9acf1453e7e95093dbafc6bd3067e1acbfc3111b1875ac4a2d366a8", "text": "# Bolster creating the metaverse\n\n- Status: accepted <!-- draft | rejected | accepted | deprecated | superseded by -->\n\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\nThe metaverse needs creators.\n\n> Open Metaverse Interoperability Group's mission: We bolster the metaverse as an open and interoperable resource for anyone, inspired by the collaborative efforts of the community.\n\n> The Open Metaverse Interoperability Group is focused on bridging virtual worlds by designing and promoting protocols for identity, social graphs, inventory, and more.

Deny\n2. Ask Master\n3. Allow always (synchronous replication)\n\nWe want to ensure various guarantees in each case.\n\n1. There is no problem\n2. We will delay sync by 1 round trip, so there is no problem because everything is synchronized against the master.\n3. We will follow a \"last-write wins\" strategy from the perspective of the relay server responsible for mastership.\n\nOther relays only need to know which server owns each object (and possibly the ownership / mastership table), and where each entity is.\n\nHaving this constraint permits us to use a model where we do not need consistent and transactional global information about object ownership,\nwhich allows the system to be simpler.\n\nIdea of separation of presence queries (who is here, reliably, tricky to figure out who of 100000 clients is relevant?) from realtime networking sync,\nwhich can flow directly from relay to relay, degrading over distance.\n\n## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\n\nNone yet. We may try prototyping this type of system in multiple ways.\n\n## Positive Consequences <!-- improvement of quality attribute satisfaction, follow-up decisions required -->\n\nThis keeps low latency but reduces the needed bandwidth to sync 100,000 entites.\n\nNapkin math:\n\n    50 bytes per frame per object * 100,000 objects = 5MB per frame.\n    5MB/frame * 20 fps = 100MB = 1Gbps\n    If we send updates of all obejcts to all objects, that requires 100Tb/s\n\n    > yea 100k users at once is impossible any way you put it. I think a realistic goal is 1k, as like, our max goal\n\n    Right, so you would need to not send updates for far away objects\n\n    Only send 1000 closest objects: 1Tb/s\n\n    + Send faraway objects at 2Hz: 100Gb/s\n\n    + Heavy delta compression: 10Gb/s\n\n    This is for all players\n\n    Thie means, in a hypothetical universe where distant objects only need position sync, a server with 10Gb/s NIC could theoretically run 100,000 concurrent users, if optimizzed!\n\n    Also, therefore, per player bandwidth **of distant objects** would be 100Kbit/s of downstream data, which is pretty small.\n\n    Again I haven't accounted for IK synchronization, or for additional nearby objects, so it could be higher here.\n    Nearby objects is a smaller problem and easier to solve, and belongs in a separate proposal.\n\n## Negative Consequences <!-- compromising quality attribute, follow-up decisions required -->\n\nWe may be overcomplicating a problem that doesn't need to be solved yet. Pure interest management may be sufficient, and we do not currently have this many users.\n\n## Option graveyard:\n\n## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\n## References\n\nSource:\n\nDiscord VC with Malek and iFire\n\nDiscord channel forum-v-sekai \"Networking with librg\" thread: https://discord.com/channels/471446618156040210/1031379649776848900/1032401929587929208\n\n## License of the contribution\n\nCopyright (c) 2022 V-Sekai contributors.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "47077aaa-5bd1-4fa7-8851-c1950b9628df": {"__data__": {"id_": "47077aaa-5bd1-4fa7-8851-c1950b9628df", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f4369d99-971b-4f11-be7d-65b74457b889", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f7ed46513fff876b44f84308dd730e64073c0b50b274052a1b658f4eda176c88"}, "2": {"node_id": "87768ba8-f2cd-4179-a89d-e450d7ceeadb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f4ad088823715201ad140260be43b15d8dd3d5a80298ae6e4db9d780f5940803"}}, "hash": "8d1a5cd4221cea43ed5ff98614e8cc8e450c71cd34fbecafeaa24a46814014e5", "text": "THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

It's been making waves in the realm of music too. One such wave is the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to craft melodies. This blueprint proposes a method for creating music using computer algorithms.\n\n## The Challenge\n\nThe mission is to create music using computer programs.\n\n## The Strategy\n\nOne promising strategy is to employ .ABC files. These files have proven effective in generating outputs with AI models like GPT-3. The .ABC files carry data in the header section, such as the key signature, tempo, and time signature, which can be incorporated into the prompt.\n\nAlternatively, we could leverage AI models to script for us. For instance, we could ask for a Python script that composes the chromatic 7th intervals from C to B in eighth notes. The output format could be something user-friendly like Lilypond or MusicXML.\n\nHere's a sneak peek at a Python script:\n\n```python\ndef generate_chromatic_seventh_intervals():\n    notes = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'A#', 'B']\n    intervals = []\n\n    for i in range(len(notes)):\n        seventh_interval = (i + 10) % len(notes)\n        intervals.append((notes[i], notes[seventh_interval]))\n\n    return intervals\n\nprint(generate_chromatic_seventh_intervals())\n```\n\nAnother feasible strategy might be to use AI models to generate Lilypond syntax. Lilypond is a robust and adaptable tool for engraving tasks of all kinds, including sheet music, complex notation, vocal music, etc. Here is an example of a simple Lilypond syntax:\n\n```lilypond\n\\relative c' {\n  c4 d e f |\n  g a b c |\n}\n```\n\nThis code will compose a sequence of eighth notes from C to C.\n\n## The Road Not Taken\n\nDuring the journey to find a solution, several paths were explored and abandoned for various reasons:\n\n1. **Using MIDI files:** While MIDI files are a common choice for music creation, they were left behind due to their complexity and the challenge in crafting them programmatically.\n\n2. **Using MusicXML:** Despite MusicXML being a comprehensive and widely supported format, it was abandoned due to its lengthy and intricate structure, which makes it tough to craft programmatically.\n\n3. **Using other music notation software:** Other music notation software like Finale and Sibelius were considered but left behind due to their proprietary nature and lack of support for the programmatic generation of music.\n\n## The Upside\n\n- This approach will pave the way for easier music creation.\n- It will sidestep the limitations posed by the intricate structure of MusicXML.\n\n## The Downside\n\n- There may be some hurdles when using AI models to generate Lilypond syntax.\n- Training small transformers to output syntactically correct .ABC files might pose a challenge.\n\n## Further Reading\n\n- [Sample .ABC files](https://gwern.net/gpt-2-music)\n- [Lilypond Notation
